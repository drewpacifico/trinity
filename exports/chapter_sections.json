You'll use this information every single day—sometimes dozens of times per day. The difference between a professional agent and an amateur is often as simple as knowing that a customer's 10-foot-tall machinery needs a step deck rather than a standard flatbed, or understanding that dairy products at 34°F cannot ship in the same reefer set at -10°F for frozen foods.\nInvest time now to master this material. Create flashcards, draw diagrams, visit truck stops to see equipment in person, talk to drivers about their trailers. The more familiar you become with equipment, the more confidently you'll quote loads and the fewer mistakes you'll make that damage your reputation.\nAs you move into Chapter 5 (Load Types and Cargo Categories), you'll build on this equipment knowledge by learning about the specific freight types you'll encounter and how they match to the equipment you've just studied.",
