    "explanation": "The analogy emphasizes that understanding the structure and relationships within the freight industry—who does what, how they interact, where you fit—makes you far more effective.

    "explanation": "Large brokerages have advantages in buying power and technology, but often provide bureaucratic, slow, inconsistent service where customers feel like small fish in a big pond.

    "correct_choice": "b",
    "explanation": "LTL is appropriate for shipments under 5,000 pounds to single destinations when cost is more important than speed. However, accessorial charges add up: liftgate ($50-150), inside delivery ($75-200), and residential delivery ($75-150). A shipment quoted at $250 might cost $475 after accessorials.

Understanding these helps you provide better LTL quotes. Light, bulky freight has high classifications and expensive LTL rates.",
