    <p>High-value cargo typically means freight worth $100,000 or more, though some customers consider anything above $50,000 high-value. This freight requires additional security measures and insurance.</p>

        <div class="callout-content">
            Standard cargo insurance only covers up to $100,000 per load. High-value freight requires additional insurance purchased for the specific shipment, typically costing 1-3% of declared value. Confirm your brokerage's insurance capabilities before accepting high-value loads.

    <h2>Security Measures for High-Value Freight</h2>

    <p>High-value freight requires security protocols beyond standard shipments:</p>

    <h3>Team Drivers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Two qualified drivers in the truck at all times</li>
        <li>One driver can rest while the other drives</li>
        <li>Continuous movement reduces theft opportunities</li>
        <li>Truck is never left unattended</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>GPS Tracking</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Real-time location monitoring</li>
        <li>Frequent position updates (every 15-30 minutes)</li>
        <li>Geofencing alerts if truck deviates from planned route</li>
        <li>Immediate notification of unexpected stops</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Secure Parking</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Approved facilities only (no truck stops or rest areas)</li>
        <li>Monitored locations with security</li>
        <li>Well-lit areas with surveillance</li>
        <li>Fenced and gated compounds preferred</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sealed Trailers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tamper-evident seals applied at origin</li>
        <li>Seal numbers recorded and verified</li>
        <li>No unauthorized access during transit</li>
        <li>Broken seals immediately reported</li>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <h2>Carrier Vetting for High-Value Freight</h2>

    <p>Not every carrier can handle high-value freight. Vetting requirements typically include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Minimum years in business (often 3+ years)</li>
        <li>Clean safety record</li>
        <li>Proven experience with high-value freight</li>
        <li>GPS tracking capabilities</li>
        <li>Written security protocols</li>
        <li>Driver background check programs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Questions to ask when high-value freight is involved:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"What is the declared value of this shipment?"</strong> Determines insurance requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>"Do you require team drivers?"</strong> Continuous movement reduces theft risk.</li>
        <li><strong>"What security protocols do you expect?"</strong> GPS tracking, secure parking, sealed trailers.</li>
        <li><strong>"Do you have specific carrier requirements?"</strong> Many high-value <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#shipper" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">shippers<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Shipper</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A business needing to move goods from one location to another, including manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and other customer types.</span></span></a> have approved carrier lists.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For new agents, prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Insurance awareness:</strong> Standard cargo insurance covers $100,000. High-value loads need additional coverage.</li>
        <li><strong>Security requirements:</strong> Team drivers, GPS tracking, and secure parking are common requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Carrier vetting:</strong> Only use established carriers with proven security track records for high-value freight.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>High-value freight commands premium rates (50-75% more for team drivers) but requires careful carrier selection and enhanced monitoring.</p>
