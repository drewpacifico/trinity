    <h2>Key Concepts to Remember</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Freight agents connect shippers with carriers</strong>, serving as logistics consultants rather than simple middlemen</li>
        <li>The trucking industry generates <strong>$800+ billion annually</strong> and moves <strong>70% of U.S. freight tonnage</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Your value proposition:</strong> time savings, expertise, flexibility, risk management, and often better pricing</li>
        <li><strong>Salaried position with commission incentives:</strong> you earn base salary plus commission on the margins you generate from arranging shipments</li>
        <li><strong>Realistic timeline:</strong> 3-12 months to build momentum, with commission earnings growing as your customer base develops</li>
        <li><strong>Professional integrity is essential</strong>—your reputation is your most valuable asset</li>
    </ul>
