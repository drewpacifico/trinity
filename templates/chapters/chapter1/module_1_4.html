    <p>As a freight agent, you work as a salaried employee with commission incentives for a licensed freight brokerage. Your income consists of a base salary that provides financial stability, plus commission earnings based on the <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#gross-margin" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">gross margin<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Gross Margin</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">The difference between what the customer pays and what the carrier receives, which is split between the agent and brokerage according to commission agreement.</span></span></a> you generate from the shipments you arrange.</p>

    <p>When you arrange a shipment, you quote a rate to your customer. You then find a <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#carrier" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">carrier<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Carrier</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A company or individual that transports goods from one place to another, including asset-based carriers, owner-operators, and fleet owners.</span></span></a> willing to haul that load for less. The difference between what the customer pays and what the carrier receives is the gross margin. Your brokerage pays you a base salary for your work, and you earn additional commission based on the margins you generate.</p>

            Example
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Customer pays $1,500, carrier receives $1,100, gross margin is $400. You receive your regular salary plus a commission percentage on that $400 margin, creating additional earning potential beyond your base compensation.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>This Compensation Structure Provides Several Advantages</h2>

    <h3>Income Stability</h3>
    <p>Your base salary ensures consistent income while you develop your book of business, removing the financial stress that purely commission-based roles create.</p>

    <h3>Performance Rewards</h3>
    <p>Commission earnings reward your effectiveness at building customer relationships, negotiating favorable rates, and managing profitable operations. The more successful you become, the more you earn.</p>

    <h3>Alignment of Interests</h3>
    <p>Your compensation aligns with your brokerage's success. When you generate healthy margins through excellent service and strong relationships, everyone benefits.</p>

    <h3>Growth Potential</h3>
    <p>As your customer base expands and your skills improve, your commission earnings grow substantially. Successful agents significantly increase their total compensation over time.</p>

    <h2>How margins work in practice</h2>

    <p>Understanding margin is essential because it directly affects your commission:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gross margin:</strong> The difference between what your customer pays and what the carrier receives. If the customer pays $2,000 and the carrier gets $1,600, your gross margin is $400.</li>
        <li><strong>Your commission:</strong> A percentage of that gross margin goes to you. The exact percentage depends on your compensation structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Higher margins = higher earnings:</strong> Learning to price accurately and negotiate effectively directly increases your income.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
        <div class="callout-title">
            <span class="callout-icon">&#128161;</span>
            Margin vs. Volume
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Some agents chase volume with thin margins. Others build fewer, higher-margin relationships. Both approaches can work, but understand the trade-offs. Ten loads at $200 margin earns the same as four loads at $500 margin, but requires more than twice the work.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Practice calculating margins with these examples:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Example 1:</strong> Customer pays $1,800, carrier receives $1,400. Gross margin = $400.</li>
        <li><strong>Example 2:</strong> Customer pays $3,200, carrier receives $2,600. Gross margin = $600.</li>
        <li><strong>Example 3:</strong> Customer pays $950, carrier receives $800. Gross margin = $150.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Every quote you give and every carrier rate you negotiate affects this calculation. As you learn pricing in later chapters, you'll develop intuition for what margins are achievable on different types of freight.</p>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For this module, understand:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>The basic math:</strong> Customer rate minus carrier rate equals gross margin. Your commission comes from that margin.</li>
        <li><strong>Why salary matters:</strong> Your base salary provides stability while you build your book of business. This removes pressure to make desperate decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>The growth trajectory:</strong> As you get better at pricing and build more customer relationships, your commission earnings grow. The ceiling is high for skilled agents.</li>
    </ul>
