    <p>As a freight agent, you work as a salaried employee with commission incentives for a licensed freight brokerage. Your income consists of a base salary that provides financial stability, plus commission earnings based on the gross margin you generate from the shipments you arrange.</p>

    <p>When you arrange a shipment, you quote a rate to your customer. You then find a carrier willing to haul that load for less. The difference between what the customer pays and what the carrier receives is the gross margin. Your brokerage pays you a base salary for your work, and you earn additional commission based on the margins you generate.</p>

            Example
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Customer pays $1,500, carrier receives $1,100, gross margin is $400. You receive your regular salary plus a commission percentage on that $400 margin, creating additional earning potential beyond your base compensation.

    <h2>This Compensation Structure Provides Several Advantages</h2>

    <h3>Income Stability</h3>
    <p>Your base salary ensures consistent income while you develop your book of business, removing the financial stress that purely commission-based roles create.</p>

    <h3>Performance Rewards</h3>
    <p>Commission earnings reward your effectiveness at building customer relationships, negotiating favorable rates, and managing profitable operations. The more successful you become, the more you earn.</p>

    <h3>Alignment of Interests</h3>
    <p>Your compensation aligns with your brokerage's success. When you generate healthy margins through excellent service and strong relationships, everyone benefits.</p>

    <h3>Growth Potential</h3>
    <p>As your customer base expands and your skills improve, your commission earnings grow substantially. Successful agents significantly increase their total compensation over time.</p>
