    <div class="action-items">
        <ul class="checklist">
            <li><strong>Write your value proposition:</strong> In your own words, explain why a business would choose to work with you instead of calling carriers directly. Practice saying this out loud until it feels natural</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm your commission structure:</strong> Review your specific commission split, payment terms, and any fees or requirements with your brokerage manager</li>
            <li><strong>Create a personal financial plan:</strong> Map out how you'll cover expenses during the 3-6 month ramp-up period while building your customer base</li>
            <li><strong>Subscribe to industry news:</strong> Sign up for FreightWaves, Transport Topics, or DAT Trendlines to start learning how industry professionals talk about the market</li>
            <li><strong>Listen to freight podcasts:</strong> Find 2-3 trucking or logistics podcasts and listen during your commute or downtime. Recommendations: FreightWaves' WHAT THE TRUCK?!?, Truck Parking Podcast, or The Loadboard</li>
            <li><strong>Follow industry voices on LinkedIn:</strong> Connect with freight brokers, carriers, and logistics professionals. Pay attention to how they discuss challenges and solutions</li>
            <li><strong>Learn the language:</strong> Start a personal glossary of terms you hear that you don't understand. Look them up and write definitions in your own words</li>
            <li><strong>Study a map:</strong> Familiarize yourself with major freight corridors, key cities, and geographic regions. Understanding where freight flows helps you think like a broker</li>
