    <p>Welcome to the freight brokerage industry. You're about to start a career that serves as the critical connection between businesses that need to move goods and the trucking companies that transport them. This isn't just another job—it's a role that's essential to the American economy.</p>

    <p>Consider this: approximately <strong>70% of all freight tonnage</strong> in the United States moves by truck. Every product on store shelves, every piece of manufacturing equipment, every construction material at a job site—most of it traveled by truck at some point. And someone had to arrange that transportation.</p>

    <p><strong>That someone is you.</strong></p>

    <p>As a freight agent, you're not merely a middleman calling carriers and passing along information. You're a logistics consultant who solves complex problems. You're a negotiator who creates value for both shippers and carriers. You're a trusted advisor who helps businesses operate more efficiently. Your clients will depend on you to understand their unique shipping needs, find the right carriers to meet those needs, and ensure their goods arrive safely, on time, and within budget.</p>
