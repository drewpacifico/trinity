    <h2>Tanker Trailers</h2>

    <p>Tankers haul liquids—fuel, chemicals, milk, juice, liquid food products, and countless other commodities. Tankers are heavily regulated, especially for <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#hazmat-hazardous-materials" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">hazardous materials<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Hazmat (Hazardous Materials)</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Regulated substances posing risks to health, safety, property, or environment, classified into nine DOT classes and requiring special handling.</span></span></a> and food-grade products.</p>

    <p><strong>Key characteristics:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> 5,000-9,000 gallons depending on product density and trailer design</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple compartments:</strong> Many tankers have 3-6 compartments allowing separate products simultaneously</li>
        <li><strong>Food-grade requirements:</strong> Tankers hauling food products must be thoroughly cleaned between loads</li>
        <li><strong>Hazmat certification:</strong> Tankers carrying hazardous materials require drivers with hazmat endorsements</li>
        <li><strong>Specialized loading/unloading:</strong> Some require pneumatic systems, heating systems, or specialized pumps</li>
    </ul>

            Tanker freight is highly specialized. Unless you develop specific expertise in liquid transportation, you'll likely refer these opportunities to specialized agents or <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#broker" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">brokers<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Broker</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">An individual or company licensed by the FMCSA to arrange transportation of freight between shippers and carriers without owning trucks. Brokers find capacity, negotiate rates, and coordinate shipments, earning revenue from the margin between what shippers pay and what carriers receive.</span></span></a>.

    <h2>Hopper Trailers</h2>

    <p>Hoppers haul dry bulk materials like grain, plastic pellets, cement powder, fly ash, sand, and similar commodities. They unload through bottom gates or pneumatic systems.</p>

    <p><strong>Types:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pneumatic <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#hopper-trailer" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">hoppers<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Hopper Trailer</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Trailers that haul dry bulk materials like grain, plastic pellets, or cement, unloading through bottom gates or pneumatic systems.</span></span></a>:</strong> Use compressed air to unload powder or small pellet materials through hoses</li>
        <li><strong>Gravity hoppers:</strong> Unload through bottom gates into pits or conveyors</li>
        <li><strong>End-dump hoppers:</strong> Tip backward to dump contents</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Like tankers, hopper freight is specialized. Most freight agents focus on boxed or palletized freight rather than bulk commodities.</p>

    <h2>Livestock Trailers</h2>

    <p>Livestock trailers transport live animals—cattle, pigs, poultry, and other livestock. These trailers have multiple decks with ventilation and are subject to strict animal welfare regulations.</p>

    <p>This is another highly specialized segment requiring specific expertise in animal handling, welfare regulations, and livestock markets.</p>

    <h2>Automobile Carriers</h2>

    <p>Auto <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#carrier" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">carriers<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Carrier</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A company or individual that transports goods from one place to another, including asset-based carriers, owner-operators, and fleet owners.</span></span></a> transport multiple vehicles simultaneously—typically 7-9 cars on a single trailer depending on vehicle sizes.</p>

    <p><strong>Types:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Open carriers:</strong> Most new cars ship on open carriers. Vehicles are exposed to weather but secure.</li>
        <li><strong>Enclosed carriers:</strong> High-value vehicles, classics, or luxury cars ship in enclosed trailers for maximum protection.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Auto transport is typically handled by specialists in vehicle logistics rather than general freight agents.</p>

    <h2>Curtain Side Trailers</h2>

    <p>Curtain side trailers (sometimes called "sliding tarp" trailers) have solid roofs and floors but sides made of heavy fabric curtains that roll open. This allows side loading with forklifts while providing weather protection similar to dry vans.</p>

    <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Side loading access eliminates need for end-of-dock positioning</li>
        <li>Faster loading/unloading than dry vans (multiple forklifts can work simultaneously from both sides)</li>
        <li>Floor-to-ceiling access simplifies loading tall items</li>
        <li>Weather protection for freight</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Curtain sides are most common in Europe but growing in North America. They work well for freight that benefits from side loading efficiency but needs weather protection.</p>

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Questions to ask when specialized equipment might be needed:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Is this a liquid, powder, or bulk material?"</strong> If yes, it probably needs tanker or hopper equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>"Are these live animals or vehicles?"</strong> Livestock and auto transport are highly specialized.</li>
        <li><strong>"Would side loading significantly speed up this shipment?"</strong> Consider curtain side trailers.</li>
        <li><strong>"Is this outside my area of expertise?"</strong> Know when to refer to specialists.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For new agents, prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recognition over expertise:</strong> Know when freight needs specialized equipment so you can refer appropriately.</li>
        <li><strong>Build specialist contacts:</strong> Develop relationships with agents or brokers who specialize in tankers, hoppers, or auto transport.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay in your lane:</strong> Don't quote specialized equipment you don't understand. Mistakes in these segments can be costly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Most freight agents focus on dry van, reefer, and flatbed. Specialized equipment represents opportunities but requires dedicated expertise to handle well.</p>
