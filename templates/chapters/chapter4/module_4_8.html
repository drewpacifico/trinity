    <p>Understanding truck classifications helps you communicate knowledgeably with <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#carrier" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">carriers<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Carrier</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A company or individual that transports goods from one place to another, including asset-based carriers, owner-operators, and fleet owners.</span></span></a> and customers about appropriate equipment.</p>

    <h2>Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR)</h2>

    <p>GVWR is the maximum total weight of the vehicle including the vehicle itself plus all cargo. It's the key metric determining truck classification.</p>

    <h2>Class 8 Trucks (GVWR over 33,000 pounds)</h2>

    <p>These are standard over-the-road semi-trucks—the heavy-duty tractors pulling trailers you see on highways. This is what you'll be booking for truckload freight.</p>

    <p><strong>Class 8 includes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Day cabs (no sleeping compartment)</li>
        <li>Sleeper cabs (with beds for long-haul drivers)</li>
        <li>Various axle configurations (tandem, tri-axle, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Class 7 Trucks (GVWR 26,001-33,000 pounds)</h2>

    <p>Medium-duty trucks used primarily for local deliveries. <a href="{{ url_for('trucks') }}#box-truck" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">Box trucks<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-image"><img src="/static/images/box_truck.jpeg" alt="Box truck"></span><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Box Truck</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A straight truck with an enclosed cargo area attached directly to the cab. Common sizes range from 10-26 feet, used for local and regional deliveries.</span></span></a>, delivery trucks, and smaller commercial vehicles fall into this class. You might occasionally book these for local moves or smaller shipments.</p>

    <h2>Class 6 and Below (GVWR under 26,001 pounds)</h2>

    <p>Light-duty commercial trucks including delivery trucks, large pickups, small box trucks, and <a href="{{ url_for('trucks') }}#sprinter-van" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">sprinter vans<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-image"><img src="/static/images/sprinter_van.jpeg" alt="Sprinter van"></span><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Sprinter Van</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A cargo van (12-15 feet long, 3,000-5,000 lb capacity) used for expedited hot shot deliveries and small urgent shipments. No CDL required.</span></span></a>. These typically handle local deliveries, small shipments, or expedited hot shot freight rather than over-the-road truckload.</p>

    <h2>Why Classification Matters</h2>

        <div class="callout-title">
            <span class="callout-icon">&#9733;</span>
            Key Takeaway
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Commercial driver's license (CDL) requirements change based on vehicle class. Drivers operating Class 8 trucks need CDLs. This affects carrier availability and rates—CDL drivers command higher wages than non-CDL drivers.
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Additionally, some regulations apply differently to different weight classes. Understanding classifications helps you discuss equipment intelligently and understand why certain equipment costs more.</p>

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Questions related to truck classifications:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Does this load require a full-size semi?"</strong> Some smaller loads might work with Class 6-7 trucks at lower cost.</li>
        <li><strong>"Does the carrier have CDL drivers?"</strong> Class 8 operations require CDL-licensed drivers.</li>
        <li><strong>"Is this local or over-the-road?"</strong> Day cabs work for local; sleeper cabs for long haul.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For new agents, prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Class 8 is your default:</strong> Most truckload freight moves on Class 8 semi-trucks. Know this category well.</li>
        <li><strong>CDL requirement:</strong> Understand that Class 8 drivers need CDLs, which affects carrier availability and rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Day cab vs. sleeper:</strong> Learn the difference and when each is appropriate based on trip length.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Truck classification knowledge helps you sound professional in carrier conversations and understand equipment cost differences.</p>
