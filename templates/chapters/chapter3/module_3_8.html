    </div>

    <p>With so many responsibilities competing for your attention, effective time management becomes critical. How you allocate your limited hours determines your success.</p>

    <h2>Customer Service Comes First</h2>

    <p>Active shipments—freight currently in transit or scheduled for imminent pickup—always take priority. When a customer calls with an urgent issue or a carrier needs direction, drop everything else and handle it immediately.</p>

    <p><strong>Why?</strong> Because active shipments represent commitments you've already made. Failing to manage them properly damages relationships with both customers and carriers. A delayed delivery costs your customer money. A carrier who can't reach you when they need guidance may never accept your loads again.</p>

        <div class="callout-content">
            Schedule your day around the reality that operational issues can arise anytime and require immediate attention.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Sales Fills the Gaps</h2>

    <p>When active shipments are running smoothly—freight has been picked up, is tracking on time, and no issues are anticipated—shift focus to business development.</p>

    <p>Morning and mid-afternoon are typically best times for prospecting calls. Decision-makers are more available then compared to late afternoon when they're wrapping up their day.</p>

            Key Takeaway
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Remain flexible. If an operational issue arises during your scheduled prospecting time, handle the operational issue. You can make prospecting calls later, but you can't recover from a service failure.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Administrative Tasks Daily</h2>

    <p>Set aside time each day for essential administrative work:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Morning review:</strong> Check active shipments, review emails, respond to overnight messages, identify priorities for the day</li>
        <li><strong>Invoicing:</strong> Bill completed deliveries daily rather than letting invoices accumulate</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Save PODs, update files, and organize paperwork while details are fresh</li>
        <li><strong>Carrier payment processing:</strong> Review and approve carrier invoices requiring payment</li>
        <li><strong>Financial tracking:</strong> Update your margin tracking and accounts receivable monitoring</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">

            <span class="callout-icon">&#128161;</span>
            Pro Tip
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Batching administrative tasks—doing all invoicing at once, processing all carrier payments together—improves efficiency compared to switching between admin and operations repeatedly throughout the day.
        </div>

    <h2>Learning Happens Continuously</h2>

    <p>Don't wait for perfectly available time to focus on learning—it won't happen. Instead, build learning into your daily routine:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Morning routine:</strong> Spend 15-30 minutes reading industry news while drinking your coffee</li>
        <li><strong>Commute time:</strong> Listen to freight industry podcasts or sales training audio</li>
        <li><strong>Slow periods:</strong> When waiting for callbacks or during brief gaps, read articles or review training materials</li>
        <li><strong>Weekly review:</strong> Dedicate an hour each week to analyzing your performance and studying relevant topics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Continuous small investments in learning compound over time into significant expertise.</p>
