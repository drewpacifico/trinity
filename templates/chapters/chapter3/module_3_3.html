    </div>

    <p>Once you've established customer relationships, the core of your daily work becomes booking and coordinating shipments. This process has five key steps that must be executed carefully every time.</p>

    <h2>Gathering Load Details</h2>

    <p>Every shipment requires specific information before you can price it accurately and find an appropriate carrier. Missing or incorrect details cause problems later, so develop a systematic approach to information gathering.</p>

    <p><strong>Essential information includes:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pickup and delivery locations</strong> with complete addresses, not just city names. Some cities have multiple facilities for the same company. You need the exact location.</li>
        <li><strong>Pickup and delivery dates and times.</strong> Is this a specific appointment or a window? What are the operating hours? Is there flexibility?</li>
        <li><strong>Commodity description.</strong> What exactly is being shipped? General terms like "freight" or "parts" aren't sufficient. You need to know if it's steel coils, furniture, food products, or machinery.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight and dimensions.</strong> Total weight, number of pieces, and dimensions of the largest piece. For palletized freight, how many pallets and weight per pallet?</li>
        <li><strong>Special requirements.</strong> Temperature control? Hazardous material? Appointment required? Liftgate needed? Straps, tarps, or special securing equipment?</li>
        <li><strong>Contact information</strong> for pickup and delivery. Who should the driver call? What are their phone numbers?</li>
    </ul>

        <div class="callout-content">
            The more complete your information, the more accurate your quote and the fewer problems you'll encounter. Missing details are the number one cause of load booking failures.

    <h2>Determining Equipment Requirements</h2>

    <p>Based on the load details, you must identify what type of truck and trailer are needed. This seems straightforward but requires careful consideration.</p>

    <p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does the freight physically fit in the equipment type I'm considering?</li>
        <li>Will the weight exceed the equipment's capacity? (Remember reefers carry less than dry vans)</li>
        <li>Does the freight require temperature control, and if so, what specific temperature?</li>
        <li>Can the freight be loaded and unloaded at the specified locations with the selected equipment?</li>
    </ul>

            Common Mistake
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Getting equipment selection wrong causes serious problems. Dispatching a dry van for freight that needs a flatbed means the carrier arrives and cannot load. You've wasted everyone's time and damaged relationships with both customer and carrier.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Pricing the Load</h2>

    <p>Determining what to charge your customer is part science and part art. You need to cover the carrier's costs plus your margin, while remaining competitive.</p>

    <p><strong>Factors affecting your price:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Current market rates for the lane.</strong> Load boards provide benchmarks, but experience on the lane tells you more than any single data point.</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty of the shipment.</strong> Easy loads (dock-to-dock, flexible timing) price lower than difficult loads (residential, tight appointments, rural areas).</li>
        <li><strong>Urgency.</strong> Customers needing immediate pickup pay more than those with flexible timing.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship and volume.</strong> Long-term customers providing consistent volume deserve better pricing than occasional one-off shipments.</li>
        <li><strong>Your desired margin.</strong> You need to earn enough to make the effort worthwhile.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonal and market conditions.</strong> During tight capacity, rates increase. During loose capacity, rates decrease.</li>
    </ul>

            Common Mistake

        <div class="callout-content">
            New agents often underprice loads because they're afraid of losing business. This creates a cycle of working hard for minimal income. Price confidently based on real market conditions and the value you provide.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Finding a Carrier</h2>

    <p>Once you've priced the load for your customer, you need to find a carrier willing to haul it at a rate that preserves your margin.</p>

    <p>Start with carriers you know and trust who operate in this lane. Carriers who've successfully handled similar freight for you before are your best option because you know their reliability.</p>

    <p>If your regular carriers are unavailable, expand your search through load boards, carrier databases, or referrals from other agents.</p>

            Pro Tip
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            When contacting carriers, provide complete information immediately. Instead of "Got a load going to Texas, you interested?" say: "I have 42,000 lbs of palletized freight, 24 pallets, picking up Thursday in Kansas City going to Houston, delivering Friday. Shipper and receiver are both warehouses with docks. Rate is $2,100. Are you available and interested?"
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Verify every carrier's authority, insurance, and safety rating before tendering freight. Your brokerage should have processes for this, but you're responsible for using only properly vetted carriers.</p>

    <h2>Confirming the Shipment</h2>

    <p>Once you've agreed on terms with a carrier, confirm everything in writing. Verbal agreements aren't sufficient—you need documentation protecting all parties.</p>

    <p><strong>Rate confirmations typically include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your contact information and the carrier's contact information</li>
        <li>Load details (commodity, weight, dimensions, piece count)</li>
        <li>Pickup information (date, time, location, contact, special instructions)</li>
        <li>Delivery information (date, time, location, contact, special instructions)</li>
        <li>Rate and payment terms</li>
        <li>Any special requirements or accessorial charges</li>
        <li>Insurance requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Send rate confirmations immediately after booking the load. Delays create opportunities for miscommunication.</p>

            <span class="callout-icon">&#9888;</span>
            Important
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Always require carrier acknowledgment of the rate confirmation. They should sign and return it or confirm receipt electronically. This acknowledgment creates a binding agreement protecting both parties.
