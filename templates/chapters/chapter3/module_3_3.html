    <p>Once you've established customer relationships, the core of your daily work becomes booking and coordinating shipments. This process has five key steps that must be executed carefully every time.</p>

    <h2>Gathering Load Details</h2>

    <p>Every shipment requires specific information before you can price it accurately and find an appropriate <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#carrier" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">carrier<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Carrier</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A company or individual that transports goods from one place to another, including asset-based carriers, owner-operators, and fleet owners.</span></span></a>. Missing or incorrect details cause problems later, so develop a systematic approach to information gathering.</p>

    <p><strong>Essential information includes:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pickup and delivery locations</strong> with complete addresses, not just city names. Some cities have multiple facilities for the same company. You need the exact location.</li>
        <li><strong>Pickup and delivery dates and times.</strong> Is this a specific appointment or a window? What are the operating hours? Is there flexibility?</li>
        <li><strong>Commodity description.</strong> What exactly is being shipped? General terms like "freight" or "parts" aren't sufficient. You need to know if it's steel coils, furniture, food products, or machinery.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight and dimensions.</strong> Total weight, number of pieces, and dimensions of the largest piece. For palletized freight, how many pallets and weight per pallet?</li>
        <li><strong>Special requirements.</strong> Temperature control? Hazardous material? Appointment required? <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#liftgate" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">Liftgate<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Liftgate</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Hydraulic platform attached to trailers that raises and lowers freight at locations lacking loading docks, with 3,000-5,000 pound capacity limits.</span></span></a> needed? Straps, tarps, or special securing equipment?</li>
        <li><strong>Contact information</strong> for pickup and delivery. Who should the driver call? What are their phone numbers?</li>
    </ul>

            The more complete your information, the more accurate your quote and the fewer problems you'll encounter. Missing details are the number one cause of load booking failures.

    <h2>Determining Equipment Requirements</h2>

    <p>Based on the load details, you must identify what type of truck and trailer are needed. This seems straightforward but requires careful consideration.</p>

    <p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does the freight physically fit in the equipment type I'm considering?</li>
        <li>Will the weight exceed the equipment's <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#capacity" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">capacity<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Capacity</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">The availability of trucks relative to loads needing transport; tight capacity (more loads than trucks) increases rates, loose capacity (more trucks than loads) decreases rates.</span></span></a>? (Remember <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#refrigerated-trailer-reefer" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">reefers<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-image"><img src="/static/images/reefer.jpeg" alt="Refrigerated trailer"></span><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Refrigerated Trailer (Reefer)</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Insulated trailers with refrigeration units maintaining temperatures from -20°F to +70°F.

        <li>Does the freight require temperature control, and if so, what specific temperature?</li>
        <li>Can the freight be loaded and unloaded at the specified locations with the selected equipment?</li>
    </ul>

            Common Mistake
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Getting equipment selection wrong causes serious problems. Dispatching a dry van for freight that needs a <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#flatbed-trailer" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">flatbed<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-image"><img src="/static/images/flatbed.jpeg" alt="Flatbed trailer"></span><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Flatbed Trailer</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">An open platform trailer (48' or 53' long) without sides or roof, used for freight requiring top/side loading or exceeding enclosed trailer dimensions.</span></span></a> means the carrier arrives and cannot load. You've wasted everyone's time and damaged relationships with both customer and carrier.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Pricing the Load</h2>

    <p>Determining what to charge your customer is part science and part art. You need to cover the carrier's costs plus your margin, while remaining competitive.</p>

    <p><strong>Factors affecting your price:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Current market rates for the lane.</strong> <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#load-board" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">Load boards<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Load Board</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Online marketplace connecting available loads with available trucks (DAT, Truckstop.com, 123Loadboard), also providing market rate intelligence.</span></span></a> provide benchmarks, but experience on the lane tells you more than any single data point.</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty of the shipment.</strong> Easy loads (dock-to-dock, flexible timing) price lower than difficult loads (residential, tight appointments, rural areas).</li>
        <li><strong>Urgency.</strong> Customers needing immediate pickup pay more than those with flexible timing.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship and volume.</strong> Long-term customers providing consistent volume deserve better pricing than occasional one-off shipments.</li>
        <li><strong>Your desired margin.</strong> You need to earn enough to make the effort worthwhile.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonal and market conditions.</strong> During tight capacity, rates increase. During loose capacity, rates decrease.</li>
    </ul>

            Common Mistake

        <div class="callout-content">
            New agents often underprice loads because they're afraid of losing business. This creates a cycle of working hard for minimal income. Price confidently based on real market conditions and the value you provide.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Finding a Carrier</h2>

    <p>Once you've priced the load for your customer, you need to find a carrier willing to haul it at a rate that preserves your margin.</p>

    <p>Start with carriers you know and trust who operate in this lane. Carriers who've successfully handled similar freight for you before are your best option because you know their reliability.</p>

    <p>If your regular carriers are unavailable, expand your search through load boards, carrier databases, or referrals from other agents.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
        <div class="callout-title">
            <span class="callout-icon">&#128161;</span>
            Pro Tip
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            When contacting carriers, provide complete information immediately. Instead of "Got a load going to Texas, you interested?" say: "I have 42,000 lbs of palletized freight, 24 pallets, picking up Thursday in Kansas City going to Houston, delivering Friday. <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#shipper" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">Shipper<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Shipper</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A business needing to move goods from one location to another, including manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and other customer types.</span></span></a> and receiver are both warehouses with docks. Rate is $2,100. Are you available and interested?"
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Verify every carrier's authority, insurance, and safety rating before tendering freight. Your brokerage should have processes for this, but you're responsible for using only properly vetted carriers.</p>

    <h2>Confirming the Shipment</h2>

    <p>Once you've agreed on terms with a carrier, confirm everything in writing. Verbal agreements aren't sufficient—you need documentation protecting all parties.</p>

    <p><strong>Rate confirmations typically include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your contact information and the carrier's contact information</li>
        <li>Load details (commodity, weight, dimensions, piece count)</li>
        <li>Pickup information (date, time, location, contact, special instructions)</li>
        <li>Delivery information (date, time, location, contact, special instructions)</li>
        <li>Rate and payment terms</li>
        <li>Any special requirements or <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#accessorial-charges" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">accessorial<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Accessorial Charges</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Additional fees charged by carriers for services beyond standard dock-to-dock delivery, such as liftgate service, inside delivery, residential delivery, or appointment scheduling.</span></span></a> charges</li>
        <li>Insurance requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Send <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#rate-confirmation-rate-con" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">rate confirmations<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Rate Confirmation (Rate Con)</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Written agreement between broker and carrier specifying load details, rate, payment terms, and special requirements.</span></span></a> immediately after booking the load. Delays create opportunities for miscommunication.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <div class="callout-title">
            <span class="callout-icon">&#9888;</span>
            Important
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Always require carrier acknowledgment of the rate confirmation. They should sign and return it or confirm receipt electronically. This acknowledgment creates a binding agreement protecting both parties.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Questions to ask when gathering load details:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"What exactly are you shipping?"</strong> Get the commodity description, not just "product" or "freight."</li>
        <li><strong>"What's the total weight and how is it packaged?"</strong> Palletized? Floor-loaded? Piece count?</li>
        <li><strong>"Are there any access restrictions at pickup or delivery?"</strong> Dock height, liftgate needed, forklift available?</li>
        <li><strong>"What's your flexibility on pickup and delivery timing?"</strong> Tight windows cost more than flexible ones.</li>
        <li><strong>"Is there anything unusual about this shipment I should know?"</strong> This catches things customers forget to mention.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For new agents, prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Information gathering discipline:</strong> Create a checklist and use it every time. Missing one detail can derail an entire shipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment matching basics:</strong> Learn the fundamental differences between dry vans, flatbeds, and reefers. Know when each is required. You'll learn more about equipment in Chapter 4.</li>
        <li><strong>Rate confirmation accuracy:</strong> Every detail in your rate confirmation must match what you told the customer and carrier. Double-check before sending.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pricing strategy and carrier negotiation skills develop with experience. Focus first on gathering complete information and executing bookings accurately.</p>
