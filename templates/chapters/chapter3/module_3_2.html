    <p>Sales isn't something you do occasionally when you need more customers. It's an ongoing process that determines your long-term success. Even when you have a full book of business, you should continue prospecting because customer relationships end unexpectedly. Companies get acquired, shipping patterns change, and decision-makers leave.</p>

    <h2>Prospecting</h2>

    <p>Prospecting means identifying potential customers who might need your services. This isn't randomly calling businesses and hoping they ship freight. It's systematically researching and targeting companies that demonstrate shipping activity.</p>

    <p><strong>Methods include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Researching companies in your target industries using business directories and online databases</li>
        <li>Driving through industrial parks and noting company names with loading docks and truck traffic</li>
        <li>Asking existing customers for referrals to other businesses they know</li>
        <li>Networking at industry events and trade shows</li>
        <li>Monitoring local business journals for company expansions or new facilities</li>
        <li>Using LinkedIn to identify shipping managers and logistics coordinators at target companies</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The goal isn't to contact hundreds of random businesses. It's to build a targeted list of qualified prospects where you can focus your efforts systematically.</p>

    <h2>Qualifying</h2>

    <p>Not every business that ships freight is a good prospect for you. Qualifying means determining whether a prospect is genuinely worth pursuing based on specific criteria.</p>

    <p><strong>Key qualification questions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do they ship with sufficient frequency to justify your investment? (At least 1-2 shipments monthly creates sustainable opportunity)</li>
        <li>Are they shipping truckload or partial truckload quantities, or just small packages?</li>
        <li>Do their shipping lanes align with your <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#carrier" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">carrier<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Carrier</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A company or individual that transports goods from one place to another, including asset-based carriers, owner-operators, and fleet owners.</span></span></a> network and expertise?</li>
        <li>Do their freight characteristics match equipment you can source reliably?</li>
        <li>Are their service expectations reasonable and achievable?</li>
        <li>Do they have a history of paying vendors on agreed terms?</li>
    </ul>

        <div class="callout-title">
            <span class="callout-icon">&#9888;</span>
            Important
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            A company shipping 50 loads monthly but expecting rates 30% below market probably isn't qualified. A company shipping 3 loads monthly with reasonable expectations and paying net 30 is qualified. Quality matters more than quantity.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Presenting</h2>

    <p>Presenting means communicating your value proposition effectively once you've identified a qualified prospect. This isn't about reading a script or delivering a memorized pitch. It's about having a genuine conversation focused on their needs.</p>

    <p><strong>Effective presentations start with questions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are their current challenges with freight?</li>
        <li>Who handles their shipping now?</li>
        <li>What's working well and what isn't?</li>
        <li>What matters most—price, reliability, or service?</li>
        <li>What problems keep their logistics manager up at night?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Listen carefully to their answers. Then connect your services directly to their specific situation. If they mentioned struggling to find <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#flatbed-trailer" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">flatbed<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-image"><img src="/static/images/flatbed.jpeg" alt="Flatbed trailer"></span><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Flatbed Trailer</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">An open platform trailer (48' or 53' long) without sides or roof, used for freight requiring top/side loading or exceeding enclosed trailer dimensions.</span></span></a> <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#capacity" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">capacity<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Capacity</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">The availability of trucks relative to loads needing transport; tight capacity (more loads than trucks) increases rates, loose capacity (more trucks than loads) decreases rates.</span></span></a> during busy seasons, explain how your flatbed carrier network solves that problem.</p>

            Common Mistake
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Delivering generic presentations about how great your company is rarely works. Specific presentations showing you understand their situation and can solve their problems work consistently.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Closing</h2>

    <p>Closing means converting prospects into customers by getting them to commit to that first shipment. Many agents struggle here because they're uncomfortable asking for the business directly.</p>

    <p>Effective closing isn't high-pressure sales tactics. It's making it easy for prospects to say yes by removing obstacles and reducing perceived risk.</p>

    <p><strong>Simple closing approaches:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Let's start with one shipment so you can experience our service firsthand without a large commitment. Does that sound reasonable?"</li>
        <li>"I understand you have existing relationships. Keep my information for situations when your regular providers are full. When capacity gets tight, I'll be here to help."</li>
        <li>"For your next shipment on this lane, let me provide a quote alongside your current provider. You can compare not just price but also our responsiveness and communication quality."</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The key is suggesting a low-risk way to try your service rather than asking them to immediately switch all their freight to you.</p>

    <h2>Relationship Management</h2>

    <p>Getting the first shipment is just the beginning. Converting that customer into a long-term, high-value relationship requires ongoing attention.</p>

    <p><strong>Relationship management includes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular communication even when you're not booking loads</li>
        <li>Sharing market intelligence about capacity conditions and rate trends</li>
        <li>Proactively alerting them to potential issues before they become problems</li>
        <li>Asking for feedback on your performance and acting on suggestions</li>
        <li>Remembering details about their business, preferences, and priorities</li>
        <li>Looking for opportunities to expand your services as their needs grow</li>
    </ul>

            Key Takeaway
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Your best new business often comes from existing customers increasing their volume with you or referring others. This only happens when you manage relationships actively rather than treating customers transactionally.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Questions to ask yourself as you develop your sales approach:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"What industries or company types am I most comfortable approaching?"</strong> Start prospecting where you have natural connections or knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>"How will I systematically track my prospects and follow-ups?"</strong> Without a system, promising leads fall through the cracks.</li>
        <li><strong>"What specific value can I offer that competitors might not?"</strong> Identify your unique strengths before you start presenting.</li>
        <li><strong>"What's my plan for handling rejection?"</strong> Most prospects say no. Prepare mentally for that reality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For new agents, prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prospecting discipline:</strong> Set a daily goal for outreach calls and stick to it. Consistency matters more than perfection.</li>
        <li><strong>Qualification skills:</strong> Learn to quickly identify whether a prospect is worth your time. Don't chase everyone.</li>
        <li><strong>The first close:</strong> Master the low-risk trial offer. "Let me handle one shipment so you can see our service" converts better than asking for all their freight.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Advanced closing techniques and complex relationship strategies become important later, but they only matter if you first build a solid foundation of consistent prospecting activity.</p>
