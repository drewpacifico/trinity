    <p>Sales isn't something you do occasionally when you need more customers. It's an ongoing process that determines your long-term success. Even when you have a full book of business, you should continue prospecting because customer relationships end unexpectedly—companies get acquired, shipping patterns change, decision-makers leave.</p>

    <h2>Prospecting</h2>

    <p>Prospecting means identifying potential customers who might need your services. This isn't randomly calling businesses and hoping they ship freight. It's systematically researching and targeting companies that demonstrate shipping activity.</p>

    <p><strong>Methods include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Researching companies in your target industries using business directories and online databases</li>
        <li>Driving through industrial parks and noting company names with loading docks and truck traffic</li>
        <li>Asking existing customers for referrals to other businesses they know</li>
        <li>Networking at industry events and trade shows</li>
        <li>Monitoring local business journals for company expansions or new facilities</li>
        <li>Using LinkedIn to identify shipping managers and logistics coordinators at target companies</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The goal isn't to contact hundreds of random businesses. It's to build a targeted list of qualified prospects where you can focus your efforts systematically.</p>

        <div class="callout-content">
            Drive through industrial parks in your area and note companies with multiple loading docks and regular truck traffic. These are active shippers who may need your services. Take photos and build a targeted prospect list.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Qualifying</h2>

    <p>Not every business that ships freight is a good prospect for you. Qualifying means determining whether a prospect is genuinely worth pursuing based on specific criteria.</p>

    <p><strong>Key qualification questions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do they ship with sufficient frequency to justify your investment? (At least 1-2 shipments monthly creates sustainable opportunity)</li>
        <li>Are they shipping truckload or partial truckload quantities, or just small packages?</li>
        <li>Do their shipping lanes align with your carrier network and expertise?</li>
        <li>Do their freight characteristics match equipment you can source reliably?</li>
        <li>Are their service expectations reasonable and achievable?</li>
        <li>Do they have a history of paying vendors on agreed terms?</li>
    </ul>

        <div class="callout-title">
            <span class="callout-icon">&#9888;</span>
            Important
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            A company shipping 50 loads monthly but expecting rates 30% below market probably isn't qualified. A company shipping 3 loads monthly with reasonable expectations and paying net 30 is qualified. Quality matters more than quantity.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Presenting</h2>

    <p>Presenting means communicating your value proposition effectively once you've identified a qualified prospect. This isn't about reading a script or delivering a memorized pitch. It's about having a genuine conversation focused on their needs.</p>

    <p><strong>Effective presentations start with questions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are their current challenges with freight?</li>
        <li>Who handles their shipping now?</li>
        <li>What's working well and what isn't?</li>
        <li>What matters most—price, reliability, or service?</li>
        <li>What problems keep their logistics manager up at night?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Listen carefully to their answers. Then connect your services directly to their specific situation. If they mentioned struggling to find flatbed capacity during busy seasons, explain how your flatbed carrier network solves that problem.</p>

            Common Mistake
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Delivering generic presentations about how great your company is rarely works. Specific presentations showing you understand their situation and can solve their problems work consistently.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Closing</h2>

    <p>Closing means converting prospects into customers by getting them to commit to that first shipment. Many agents struggle here because they're uncomfortable asking for the business directly.</p>

    <p>Effective closing isn't high-pressure sales tactics. It's making it easy for prospects to say yes by removing obstacles and reducing perceived risk.</p>

    <p><strong>Simple closing approaches:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Let's start with one shipment so you can experience our service firsthand without a large commitment. Does that sound reasonable?"</li>
        <li>"I understand you have existing relationships. Keep my information for situations when your regular providers are full. When capacity gets tight, I'll be here to help."</li>
        <li>"For your next shipment on this lane, let me provide a quote alongside your current provider. You can compare not just price but also our responsiveness and communication quality."</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The key is suggesting a low-risk way to try your service rather than asking them to immediately switch all their freight to you.</p>

    <h2>Relationship Management</h2>

    <p>Getting the first shipment is just the beginning. Converting that customer into a long-term, high-value relationship requires ongoing attention.</p>

    <p><strong>Relationship management includes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular communication even when you're not booking loads</li>
        <li>Sharing market intelligence about capacity conditions and rate trends</li>
        <li>Proactively alerting them to potential issues before they become problems</li>
        <li>Asking for feedback on your performance and acting on suggestions</li>
        <li>Remembering details about their business, preferences, and priorities</li>
        <li>Looking for opportunities to expand your services as their needs grow</li>
    </ul>

            Key Takeaway
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Your best new business often comes from existing customers increasing their volume with you or referring others. This only happens when you manage relationships actively rather than treating customers transactionally.
