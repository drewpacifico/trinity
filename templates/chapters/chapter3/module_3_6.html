    </div>

    <p>Behind-the-scenes administrative work isn't glamorous, but it's essential for operating legally and professionally.</p>

    <h2>Carrier Vetting</h2>

    <p>Federal regulations require brokers to verify that carriers have proper authority, insurance, and acceptable safety ratings before tendering freight. This isn't optional—it's a legal requirement that protects you from liability.</p>

    <p><strong>Every carrier you use must have:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Active FMCSA operating authority (MC number or DOT number)</li>
        <li>Valid commercial auto liability insurance at required levels ($750,000 minimum for most freight, $5,000,000 for hazardous materials)</li>
        <li>Acceptable safety rating (avoid carriers with "Unsatisfactory" ratings or consistently poor inspection results)</li>
    </ul>

            Important
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Most brokerages have systems for carrier vetting that check these requirements automatically. However, you're responsible for ensuring you only use approved carriers. Using a carrier without proper authority or insurance exposes you to enormous liability if accidents or cargo loss occurs.

    </div>

    <p>Beyond regulatory requirements, evaluate carriers based on their reputation, equipment quality, and reliability. A carrier with legal authority but terrible service damages your customer relationships.</p>

    <h2>Record Keeping</h2>

    <p>Maintain organized records of all transactions, communications, and documents. This serves multiple purposes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial management:</strong> You need records for invoicing, payment processing, and tax preparation</li>
        <li><strong>Dispute resolution:</strong> When disagreements arise months after delivery, detailed records prove what actually happened</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory compliance:</strong> FMCSA regulations require brokers maintain specific records for defined periods (typically three years)</li>
        <li><strong>Business analysis:</strong> Historical records show trends in customer behavior, carrier performance, and margin evolution</li>
    </ul>

            Key Takeaway
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Whatever system you use—whether sophisticated transportation management software or basic spreadsheets—ensure consistency. Every load should have a standardized file containing all relevant documents and communications.

    <h2>Regulatory Compliance</h2>

    <p>Multiple regulations govern freight brokerage operations. While your brokerage's compliance team handles most regulatory requirements, you must understand basic obligations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Broker authority requirements:</strong> Brokerages must maintain active FMCSA broker authority and the required $75,000 surety bond or trust fund</li>
        <li><strong>Cargo claims procedures:</strong> The Carmack Amendment establishes procedures and timelines for filing and resolving cargo loss or damage claims</li>
        <li><strong>Hours of service rules:</strong> Understanding driver HOS regulations helps you set realistic transit expectations</li>
        <li><strong>Hazardous materials regulations:</strong> Hazmat shipments require specific documentation, placarding, and carrier qualifications</li>
        <li><strong>Food safety regulations:</strong> FSMA establishes requirements for temperature control, sanitation, and documentation for food shipments</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You don't need to become a regulatory expert, but understanding basic requirements helps you avoid violations and protect your customers and carriers.</p>

    <h2>Technology Management</h2>

    <p>Modern freight operations depend on technology—transportation management systems, load boards, tracking platforms, communication tools, and document management systems.</p>

    <p><strong>Learn to use these tools effectively:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your TMS for quoting, booking, tracking, and invoicing</li>
        <li>Load boards for finding carriers and researching market rates</li>
        <li>Email and phone systems for professional communication</li>
        <li>Document scanning and electronic signature tools for paperwork management</li>
        <li>Reporting tools for analyzing your business performance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Technology should make your work easier and more efficient, not more complicated. If you're struggling with a system, ask for training.</p>
