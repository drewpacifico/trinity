    <p>Behind-the-scenes administrative work isn't glamorous, but it's essential for operating legally and professionally.</p>

    <h2>Carrier Vetting</h2>

    <p>Federal regulations require <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#broker" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">brokers<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Broker</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">An individual or company licensed by the FMCSA to arrange transportation of freight between shippers and carriers without owning trucks. Brokers find capacity, negotiate rates, and coordinate shipments, earning revenue from the margin between what shippers pay and what carriers receive.</span></span></a> to verify that <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#carrier" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">carriers<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Carrier</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A company or individual that transports goods from one place to another, including asset-based carriers, owner-operators, and fleet owners.</span></span></a> have proper authority, insurance, and acceptable safety ratings before tendering freight. This isn't optional. It's a legal requirement that protects you from liability.</p>

    <p><strong>Every carrier you use must have:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Active <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#fmcsa-federal-motor-carrier-safety-administration" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">FMCSA<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration)</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">The primary regulatory body for trucking, issuing operating authority, enforcing safety regulations, and maintaining carrier safety ratings.</span></span></a> operating authority (MC number or <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#dot-department-of-transportation" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">DOT<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">DOT (Department of Transportation)</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">The federal parent agency overseeing transportation policy, including FMCSA and other modal administrations.</span></span></a> number)</li>
        <li>Valid commercial auto liability insurance at required levels ($750,000 minimum for most freight, $5,000,000 for <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#hazmat-hazardous-materials" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">hazardous materials<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Hazmat (Hazardous Materials)</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Regulated substances posing risks to health, safety, property, or environment, classified into nine DOT classes and requiring special handling.</span></span></a>)</li>
        <li>Acceptable safety rating (avoid carriers with "Unsatisfactory" ratings or consistently poor inspection results)</li>
    </ul>

            <span class="callout-icon">&#9888;</span>
            Important
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Most brokerages have systems for carrier vetting that check these requirements automatically. However, you're responsible for ensuring you only use approved carriers. Using a carrier without proper authority or insurance exposes you to enormous liability if accidents or cargo loss occurs.
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Beyond regulatory requirements, evaluate carriers based on their reputation, equipment quality, and reliability. A carrier with legal authority but terrible service damages your customer relationships.</p>

    <h2>Record Keeping</h2>

    <p>Maintain organized records of all transactions, communications, and documents. This serves multiple purposes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial management:</strong> You need records for invoicing, payment processing, and tax preparation</li>
        <li><strong>Dispute resolution:</strong> When disagreements arise months after delivery, detailed records prove what actually happened</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory compliance:</strong> FMCSA regulations require brokers maintain specific records for defined periods (typically three years)</li>
        <li><strong>Business analysis:</strong> Historical records show trends in customer behavior, carrier performance, and margin evolution</li>
    </ul>

            Key Takeaway
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Whatever system you use—whether sophisticated transportation management software or basic spreadsheets—ensure consistency. Every load should have a standardized file containing all relevant documents and communications.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Regulatory Compliance</h2>

    <p>Multiple regulations govern freight brokerage operations. While your brokerage's compliance team handles most regulatory requirements, you must understand basic obligations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Broker authority requirements:</strong> Brokerages must maintain active FMCSA broker authority and the required $75,000 surety bond or trust fund</li>
        <li><strong>Cargo claims procedures:</strong> The Carmack Amendment establishes procedures and timelines for filing and resolving cargo loss or damage claims</li>
        <li><strong>Hours of service rules:</strong> Understanding driver <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#hours-of-service-hos" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">HOS<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Hours of Service (HOS)</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Federal regulations limiting driver operating hours: 11-hour driving limit, 14-hour duty window, 60/70-hour work week, 30-minute break requirement.</span></span></a> regulations helps you set realistic transit expectations</li>
        <li><strong>Hazardous materials regulations:</strong> Hazmat shipments require specific documentation, placarding, and carrier qualifications</li>
        <li><strong>Food safety regulations:</strong> FSMA establishes requirements for temperature control, sanitation, and documentation for food shipments</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You don't need to become a regulatory expert, but understanding basic requirements helps you avoid violations and protect your customers and carriers.</p>

    <h2>Technology Management</h2>

    <p>Modern freight operations depend on technology—transportation management systems, <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#load-board" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">load boards<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Load Board</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Online marketplace connecting available loads with available trucks (DAT, Truckstop.com, 123Loadboard), also providing market rate intelligence.</span></span></a>, tracking platforms, communication tools, and document management systems.</p>

    <p><strong>Learn to use these tools effectively:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#tms-transportation-management-system" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">TMS<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">TMS (Transportation Management System)</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Software combining freight operations with customer relationship management, often provided by brokerages to agents.</span></span></a> for quoting, booking, tracking, and invoicing</li>
        <li>Load boards for finding carriers and researching market rates</li>
        <li>Email and phone systems for professional communication</li>
        <li>Document scanning and electronic signature tools for paperwork management</li>
        <li>Reporting tools for analyzing your business performance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Technology should make your work easier and more efficient, not more complicated. If you're struggling with a system, ask for training.</p>

            Pro Tip
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Stay informed about new technologies that might improve your operations. The freight industry continues evolving technologically, and agents who adopt useful innovations gain competitive advantages.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Questions to ask about your administrative processes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Is this carrier approved in our system?"</strong> Never tender freight to an unvetted carrier, no matter how urgent the load.</li>
        <li><strong>"Can I find any document from any shipment within 60 seconds?"</strong> If not, your filing system needs improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>"Am I using my TMS effectively?"</strong> Identify features you're not using that could save time.</li>
        <li><strong>"Do I understand the compliance requirements for this shipment?"</strong> Hazmat, food safety, and oversized loads have specific rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For new agents, prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Carrier vetting basics:</strong> Learn your brokerage's carrier qualification process before booking your first load. This isn't negotiable.</li>
        <li><strong>Document organization:</strong> Set up a consistent filing system from day one. It's much harder to organize retroactively.</li>
        <li><strong>TMS proficiency:</strong> Master the core functions of your transportation management system. Speed and accuracy improve with practice.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Regulatory expertise develops over time. Start by understanding the basics and knowing when to ask for help on specialized requirements.</p>
