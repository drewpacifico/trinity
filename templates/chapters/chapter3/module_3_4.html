    <p>After booking a load, your work isn't finished. It's just beginning. Operational execution means ensuring the shipment proceeds smoothly from pickup through delivery.</p>

    <h2>Tracking and Monitoring</h2>

    <p>From the moment a load is dispatched until delivery is confirmed, you should know where that truck is and whether it's progressing as planned.</p>

    <p><strong>Key tracking milestones:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Confirm the <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#carrier" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">carrier<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Carrier</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A company or individual that transports goods from one place to another, including asset-based carriers, owner-operators, and fleet owners.</span></span></a> picked up on time and the freight was loaded correctly</li>
        <li>Check in during transit, especially on longer hauls, to verify progress</li>
        <li>Confirm the delivery appointment is still valid and the receiver is prepared</li>
        <li>Verify successful delivery and obtain <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#proof-of-delivery-pod" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">proof of delivery<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Proof of Delivery (POD)</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Signed documentation confirming freight was delivered, required for invoicing customers and proving shipment completion.</span></span></a> (POD) documentation</li>
    </ul>

            Pro Tip
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Don't wait for problems to surface. Proactive communication—checking in before issues arise—allows you to address small problems before they become crises. If a driver is running behind schedule, you want to know early so you can notify the customer.
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Modern technology helps with tracking, but don't rely solely on automated systems. A five-minute phone call with a driver often reveals important information that GPS tracking can't provide.</p>

    <h2>Problem Resolution</h2>

    <p>Despite your best efforts, problems will occur. Trucks break down. Weather delays shipments. Facilities miss appointments. How you handle these situations determines whether customers remain loyal.</p>

    <p><strong>When problems arise, follow this process:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Gather complete information immediately.</strong> What exactly happened? What's the current status? What are the options for resolution?</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate transparently with all parties.</strong> Tell your customer about the problem right away, explain what you're doing to resolve it, and provide realistic timelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Develop solutions quickly.</strong> Can another carrier complete the delivery? Can the appointment be rescheduled? Do you need to arrange transloading?</li>
        <li><strong>Follow through until resolution is complete.</strong> Stay involved until the freight is delivered and all parties are satisfied.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow up after resolution.</strong> Call the customer to confirm satisfaction. Learn from what happened to prevent similar problems.</li>
    </ol>

            Key Takeaway
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Customers remember how you handle problems more than they remember perfect shipments. Excellent service recovery often strengthens relationships more than if the problem never occurred.

    <h2>Documentation Management</h2>

    <p>Freight transportation creates substantial documentation. Managing it properly protects you legally, facilitates payment, and provides records for resolving disputes.</p>

    <p><strong>Essential documents for every shipment:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bills of Lading (<a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#bill-of-lading-bol" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">BOL<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Bill of Lading (BOL)</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">The contract between shipper and carrier specifying freight details, destination, and terms; serves as receipt at pickup and proof of delivery.</span></span></a>):</strong> The contract between <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#shipper" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">shipper<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Shipper</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A business needing to move goods from one location to another, including manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and other customer types.</span></span></a> and carrier specifying what's being shipped and the terms</li>
        <li><strong>Proof of Delivery (POD):</strong> Signed documentation confirming freight was delivered—you need this to invoice customers</li>
        <li><strong>Rate confirmations:</strong> The agreement between you and the carrier specifying rate and terms</li>
        <li><strong>Inspection reports:</strong> For freight requiring quality checks or special handling</li>
        <li><strong>Freight claims documentation:</strong> Photos, inspection reports, BOLs, and repair estimates if damage occurs</li>
    </ul>

            Important
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Organize documentation systematically. Three months after delivery, when a customer questions a charge or a carrier disputes payment, you need immediate access to supporting documentation.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Customer Communication</h2>

    <p>Throughout the shipment lifecycle, proactive communication builds trust and prevents anxious phone calls.</p>

    <p><strong>Communication best practices:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Send pickup confirmation immediately after the carrier loads</li>
        <li>Provide mid-transit updates on longer hauls</li>
        <li>Alert customers immediately to any delays or problems. Don't wait for them to call you.</li>
        <li>Send delivery confirmation as soon as you receive it</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
        <div class="callout-title">
            <span class="callout-icon">&#128161;</span>
            Pro Tip
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Many customers appreciate regular updates even when everything is going perfectly. It reassures them you're monitoring their freight attentively.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Questions to ask yourself during shipment execution:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"When did I last check on this load?"</strong> If it's been more than a few hours on an active shipment, check in.</li>
        <li><strong>"Does the customer know the current status?"</strong> If not, send an update before they have to ask.</li>
        <li><strong>"What could go wrong between now and delivery?"</strong> Anticipate problems and monitor accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>"Do I have everything I need to invoice once delivered?"</strong> BOL, POD, and any <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#accessorial-charges" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">accessorial<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Accessorial Charges</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Additional fees charged by carriers for services beyond standard dock-to-dock delivery, such as liftgate service, inside delivery, residential delivery, or appointment scheduling.</span></span></a> documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For new agents, prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Proactive check-ins:</strong> Call drivers and dispatchers regularly. Don't wait for problems to surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer communication habits:</strong> Make updates automatic, not reactive. Send confirmation at pickup and delivery every time.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation collection:</strong> Get PODs immediately. Chasing paperwork weeks later wastes time and delays payment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Problem resolution skills develop with experience. Focus first on establishing consistent tracking and communication habits that prevent small issues from becoming major problems.</p>
