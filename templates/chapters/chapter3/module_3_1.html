    </div>

    <p>As a freight agent, you're running a business within a business. Every day requires you to wear multiple hats—salesperson, operations coordinator, problem solver, customer service representative, and financial manager. Understanding these different roles and how they interconnect helps you allocate your time effectively and develop the skills that matter most.</p>

    <h2>Your responsibilities fall into six major categories:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sales and Business Development:</strong> Finding and winning new customers, then growing those relationships over time</li>
        <li><strong>Load Booking and Coordination:</strong> Gathering shipment details, pricing loads, finding carriers, and confirming agreements</li>
        <li><strong>Operational Execution:</strong> Tracking shipments, solving problems, and ensuring successful deliveries</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Management:</strong> Invoicing customers, paying carriers, and managing your margins</li>
        <li><strong>Administrative and Compliance Tasks:</strong> Carrier vetting, record keeping, and regulatory compliance</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Learning and Improvement:</strong> Staying current on market conditions and developing your skills</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Let's break down each category so you understand exactly what you'll be doing and why it matters.</p>

            As a freight agent, you're not just booking loads—you're managing six distinct responsibility categories simultaneously. Success requires developing competence in all six areas, not just one or two.
