    <h2>Relationship Building</h2>

    <p>Your carrier network and customer relationships are assets you build over time. Invest continuously in strengthening these relationships:</p>

    <h3>With Customers</h3>
    <p>Provide consistent value beyond just booking loads. Share market intelligence. Offer insights that help them optimize their logistics. Be responsive and reliable. Build personal connections that transcend transactional relationships.</p>

    <h3>With Carriers</h3>
    <p>Pay fairly and promptly. Communicate clearly and respectfully. Provide regular freight when possible. Address their concerns seriously. Recognize that drivers and dispatchers are professionals deserving respect.</p>

    <h3>With Industry Peers</h3>
    <p>Other agents (especially those in non-competing specialties) can be valuable sources of advice, referrals, and market intelligence. Don't view everyone as competition—many relationships are mutually beneficial.</p>

    <p>Building strong relationships takes time but pays dividends throughout your career. People prefer working with people they know, like, and trust.</p>
