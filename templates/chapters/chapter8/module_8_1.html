    <p>Freight sales isn't about pushing services onto reluctant customers. It's about understanding their needs deeply and providing solutions that genuinely help their businesses. Consultative selling builds long-term relationships rather than generating one-time transactions.</p>

    <p>The fundamental shift in consultative selling is from "How can I sell my services?" to "How can I help solve their logistics challenges?" When you genuinely focus on helping customers succeed, sales become a natural outcome rather than a forced transaction.</p>

    <h2>The Consultative Sales Process</h2>

    <p>Consultative selling follows four distinct phases, each building on the previous one.</p>

    <h3>Phase 1: Discovery (Understanding Needs)</h3>

    <p>Discovery means learning everything relevant about the prospect's shipping operations, challenges, and goals. The key is asking open-ended questions and listening carefully to answers.</p>

    <p><strong>Essential discovery questions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Tell me about your shipping operations. What does a typical week look like?"</li>
        <li>"What challenges do you face with freight transportation?"</li>
        <li>"How do shipping delays or problems impact your business operations?"</li>
        <li>"What's most important to you in freight service—price, reliability, speed?"</li>
        <li>"Who makes decisions about freight providers? What's your evaluation process?"</li>
        <li>"What's working well with your current freight arrangements? What would you change?"</li>
    </ul>

            The 80/20 Rule
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            During discovery, prospects should talk 80% of the time, and you should talk 20%. If you're doing most of the talking, you're not discovering—you're presenting prematurely.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Phase 2: Analysis (Connecting Needs to Solutions)</h3>

    <p>After thorough discovery, analyze what you've learned:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify patterns in their shipping needs</li>
        <li>Recognize problems you can solve</li>
        <li>Determine which services match their priorities</li>
        <li>Calculate potential value you can provide</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Phase 3: Recommendation (Presenting Solutions)</h3>

    <p>Present your recommendations in terms of their specific situation:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Restate their situation</strong> to confirm understanding</li>
        <li><strong>Explain how your services</strong> address their specific needs</li>
        <li><strong>Provide concrete examples</strong> of how you've helped similar customers</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Phase 4: Validation (Confirming Fit)</h3>

    <p>After presenting your recommendation, validate that it addresses their needs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Does this approach address your concerns?"</li>
        <li>"Would this level of communication meet your expectations?"</li>
        <li>"Are there other aspects we should discuss?"</li>
    </ul>

        <div class="callout-content">
            Validation ensures you're solving the right problems in ways that meet their needs. It also engages prospects in evaluating your solution rather than you simply pitching at them.

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Discovery questions to ask every prospect:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Tell me about your shipping operations. What does a typical week look like?"</strong> Understand their volume and patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>"What challenges do you face with freight transportation?"</strong> Identify problems you can solve.</li>
        <li><strong>"What's most important to you—price, reliability, or speed?"</strong> Learn their priorities.</li>
        <li><strong>"What's working well with your current arrangements? What would you change?"</strong> Find gaps you can fill.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For new agents, prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Listen 80%, talk 20%:</strong> Discovery is about understanding, not pitching.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask follow-up questions:</strong> Dig deeper when prospects mention challenges or concerns.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect needs to solutions:</strong> Only present services that address their specific situation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Consultative selling takes longer initially but builds relationships that last. Rushing to pitch without understanding needs loses more sales than it wins.</p>
