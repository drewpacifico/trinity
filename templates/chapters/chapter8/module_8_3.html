            Listen during discovery to identify which motivation drives each prospect. Then tailor your presentation to emphasize the factors they care about most. The same services can be positioned very differently depending on what the customer values.

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Questions to identify buying motivations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"What's most important to you in freight service?"</strong> Their answer reveals primary motivation.</li>
        <li><strong>"What problems have you experienced with previous providers?"</strong> Past pain points indicate current priorities.</li>
        <li><strong>"How do you evaluate freight providers?"</strong> Their criteria reveal what they value.</li>
        <li><strong>"What would make you switch from your current provider?"</strong> Identifies what they're missing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For new agents, prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Listen for motivation clues:</strong> Words like "reliable," "affordable," "easy," or "innovative" reveal priorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Tailor your presentation:</strong> Emphasize factors that match their motivation.</li>
        <li><strong>Recognize mixed motivations:</strong> Most buyers have primary and secondary priorities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The same services can be positioned very differently depending on what the customer values. Listen carefully and adapt your approach.</p>
