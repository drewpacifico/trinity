    <p>Cross-border freight introduces additional regulatory complexity requiring specialized knowledge and <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#carrier" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">carrier<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Carrier</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A company or individual that transports goods from one place to another, including asset-based carriers, owner-operators, and fleet owners.</span></span></a> capabilities.</p>

    <h2>Customs Documentation</h2>

    <p>International shipments require customs documentation including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Commercial invoice:</strong> Describes goods, values, country of origin, buyer/seller information</li>
        <li><strong>USMCA Certificate of Origin:</strong> For goods qualifying for duty-free treatment under United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement</li>
        <li><strong>Shipper's Export Declaration:</strong> For certain exports exceeding value thresholds</li>
        <li><strong>Specialized documents:</strong> Some commodities require additional permits, certificates, or documentation (food products, chemicals, certain agricultural items)</li>
    </ul>

Errors cause delays, fines, and frustrated customers.

    <h2>Carrier Authority Requirements</h2>

    <p>Carriers must have specific operating authority to cross international borders.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>U.S.-Canada:</strong> Carriers need <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#fmcsa-federal-motor-carrier-safety-administration" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">FMCSA<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration)</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">The primary regulatory body for trucking, issuing operating authority, enforcing safety regulations, and maintaining carrier safety ratings.</span></span></a> authority PLUS Canada-specific operating authority. Not all U.S. carriers have Canadian authority.</li>
        <li><strong>U.S.-Mexico:</strong> Similar requirements for Mexican operating authority beyond domestic U.S. authority.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Verify cross-border authority before booking international loads. Using carriers without proper authority causes problems at borders.</p>

    <h2>Driver Documentation</h2>

    <p>Drivers crossing borders need appropriate documentation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Passports:</strong> Required for drivers crossing into Canada or Mexico</li>
        <li><strong>FAST cards:</strong> Trusted traveler program cards for frequent crossers, expediting border crossings</li>
        <li><strong>Commercial Driver's License:</strong> Must be valid for international operations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some drivers avoid international runs due to documentation requirements or preferences. Confirm driver willingness before accepting cross-border loads.</p>

    <h2>Border Crossing Delays</h2>

    <p>Even with proper documentation, border crossings introduce delays:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inspection time:</strong> Customs and border protection inspections vary from quick clearances to detailed examinations</li>
        <li><strong>Traffic:</strong> Major border crossings experience significant congestion during peak times</li>
        <li><strong>Random inspections:</strong> Any shipment may be selected for detailed inspection adding hours to transit</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation issues:</strong> Errors or missing documents can delay clearance significantly</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Build extra time into transit estimates for international shipments. What takes one day domestically might take two or three with border crossings.</p>

    <h2>Drayage Operations</h2>

    <p>Many cross-border operations use "drayage"—short-distance trucking between border crossings and nearby facilities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>U.S. carrier brings freight to border</li>
        <li>Drayage carrier crosses the border</li>
        <li>Local carrier handles final delivery</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This model allows carriers to operate within their authorized regions while completing international moves.</p>

        <div class="callout-content">
            If cross-border freight is a significant part of your business, consider specializing and developing expertise. If it's occasional, partner with freight forwarders or customs brokers who handle the complexity while you focus on the domestic portions.

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Questions to ask when cross-border freight is involved:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Is this going to Canada or Mexico?"</strong> Different requirements and carrier authorities apply.</li>
        <li><strong>"Do you have all customs documentation prepared?"</strong> Commercial invoice, certificates of origin, and other documents are required.</li>
        <li><strong>"Does your carrier have cross-border authority?"</strong> Not all U.S. carriers can cross international borders.</li>
        <li><strong>"What is the commodity and value?"</strong> Some products require additional permits or inspections.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For new agents, prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recognize complexity:</strong> Cross-border freight requires specialized knowledge. Don't guess.</li>
        <li><strong>Build extra time:</strong> Border crossings add delays. What takes one day domestically may take two or three internationally.</li>
        <li><strong>Partner when needed:</strong> If cross-border freight is occasional, work with freight forwarders or customs brokers who specialize in it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Cross-border freight can be profitable but requires expertise. Know when to ask for help or partner with specialists.</p>
