    <p>Construction companies need to move equipment, materials, and supplies to job sites. These shipments often involve heavy, oversized, or irregularly shaped items.</p>

    <h2>What makes them good customers</h2>

    <p>They need specialized equipment like flatbeds, step decks, and heavy haul trailers, which command higher rates and margins. They're often willing to pay premium rates for reliable service because project timelines depend on material delivery. They value expertise in handling challenging freight and difficult delivery locations.</p>

    <h2>Challenges you'll face</h2>

    <p>Shipping patterns are irregular and project-based rather than consistently scheduled. Job site deliveries can be challenging due to rough terrain, limited access, lack of loading equipment. Projects may be in remote locations where carrier availability is limited. Economic downturns significantly impact construction activity.</p>

            Real Example
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            A construction agent specializing in flatbed freight earns 25-30% higher margins than general freight agents because specialized equipment knowledge and challenging job site expertise command premium pricing.

    <h2>Your best approach</h2>

    <p>Emphasize your equipment expertise and ability to handle difficult deliveries. Build relationships with flatbed and specialized equipment carriers who can navigate challenging situations. Be responsive because construction delays are expensive. Consider focusing on a specific construction niche (commercial, residential, civil engineering) to develop specialized expertise.</p>
