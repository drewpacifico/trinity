    <p>Construction companies move equipment, materials, and supplies to job sites. These shipments often involve heavy, oversized, or irregularly shaped items. Selling this freight requires equipment knowledge you won't need for general dry van work.</p>

    <h2>What you need to learn first</h2>

    <p>Construction freight requires understanding specialized equipment before you can sell effectively. Here are the trailer types you'll encounter:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#flatbed-trailer" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">Flatbed<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-image"><img src="/static/images/flatbed.jpeg" alt="Flatbed trailer"></span><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Flatbed Trailer</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">An open platform trailer (48' or 53' long) without sides or roof, used for freight requiring top/side loading or exceeding enclosed trailer dimensions.</span></span></a>:</strong> Open trailers for lumber, steel, pipe, and materials that can be loaded from the side or top. The most common trailer in construction freight.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#step-deck-drop-deck-trailer" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">Step deck<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-image"><img src="/static/images/step_deck.jpeg" alt="Step deck trailer"></span><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Step Deck (Drop Deck) Trailer</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A flatbed with two deck levels (higher front, lower rear at ~3.5 feet off ground), accommodating 10-11 foot tall freight.</span></span></a>:</strong> A flatbed with a lower deck height for taller items that won't clear standard highway heights on a regular flatbed.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#rgn-removable-gooseneck-trailer" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">RGN (Removable Gooseneck)<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">RGN (Removable Gooseneck) Trailer</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A lowboy trailer where the front section detaches to create a loading ramp, allowing wheeled equipment to roll on and off.</span></span></a>:</strong> The front of the trailer detaches so heavy machinery like excavators and bulldozers can drive directly onto it.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#conestoga-trailer" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">Conestoga<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Conestoga Trailer</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A flatbed trailer with a rolling tarp system that slides on rails, providing weather protection while allowing side loading access.</span></span></a>:</strong> A flatbed with a rolling tarp system for freight that needs weather protection but requires side loading access.</li>
    </ul>

            <p>Legal load limits vary by state.

All of these affect pricing and transit time. Know when to involve your ops team versus what you can quote directly.</p>

    <h2>Job site realities</h2>

    <p>Construction deliveries aren't like warehouse deliveries. Understanding these challenges will help you set proper expectations with customers and carriers:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>No receiving dock:</strong> Many sites have no dock, no forklift, and limited space to turn a 53' trailer. Ask customers what equipment they have on-site to receive freight.</li>
        <li><strong>Driver assist:</strong> When a load requires "driver assist," it often means the driver is unloading by hand. This affects carrier willingness and rates. Some carriers won't take these loads at any price.</li>
        <li><strong>Ground conditions:</strong> Mud, gravel, and unfinished roads can limit equipment access. A carrier who shows up and can't reach the delivery point is a failed pickup that's on you.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited access:</strong> Urban construction sites may have narrow streets, low clearances, or time restrictions for deliveries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why they're worth the complexity</h2>

    <p>Despite the challenges, construction companies can be excellent customers:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Higher margins:</strong> Specialized equipment commands better rates than standard dry van freight</li>
        <li><strong>Premium for reliability:</strong> Project timelines depend on material delivery, so they'll pay more for brokers who deliver consistently</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship-driven:</strong> Once you prove you understand their challenges, you become a trusted partner rather than a commodity vendor</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout-example">
        <div class="callout-title">
            <span class="callout-icon">&#128161;</span>
            Why Responsiveness Wins
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p>Construction runs on tight schedules. A delayed concrete pour or missing steel shipment can idle an entire crew at hundreds of dollars per hour. Customers will pay more for brokers who answer the phone, confirm pickups quickly, and communicate proactively about delays. <strong>Speed and reliability beat price in this market.</strong></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>How to apply this knowledge</h2>

    <p>Once you understand the equipment and challenges, you can have real conversations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ask about site conditions:</strong> "What equipment do you have on-site to receive this freight?" This tells you what trailer type and <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#accessorial-charges" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">accessorial<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Accessorial Charges</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Additional fees for services beyond standard dock-to-dock delivery, such as liftgate service, inside delivery, residential delivery, or appointment scheduling.</span></span></a> services are needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Qualify your carriers:</strong> When a carrier says they have "flatbed experience," ask follow-ups: Do they have tarps? Straps? Are they comfortable with job site deliveries?</li>
        <li><strong>Quote with context:</strong> "This needs a step deck because of the height, and we're building in extra time because the site has limited access." Customers trust brokers who explain the why.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>Once you're comfortable with construction basics, consider specializing in one segment:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Commercial construction:</strong> Office buildings, retail, and warehouses. Often urban sites with tight access but professional receiving crews.</li>
        <li><strong>Residential/subdivision:</strong> High volume, repetitive shipments (lumber, roofing, concrete), tighter margins but steady work</li>
        <li><strong>Civil engineering:</strong> Infrastructure projects like roads, bridges, and utilities. Often remote locations with heavy equipment focus.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Specialization builds expertise faster and makes you the go-to person for that freight type. An agent known for "civil construction flatbed" will get referrals that a generalist won't.</p>
