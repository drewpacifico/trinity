    <p>Farms, cooperatives, and agricultural processors need to move crops, livestock, feed, equipment, and supplies. This sector has unique characteristics driven by seasonal production cycles.</p>

    <h2>What makes them good customers</h2>

    <p>During harvest seasons, volume can be extremely high with urgent time requirements. Many agricultural products require specialized equipment like refrigerated trailers, hoppers, or livestock trailers. Rural locations often have limited carrier competition, creating opportunities for agents who understand these markets.</p>

    <h2>Challenges you'll face</h2>

    <p>Extreme seasonality means feast or famine, with intense activity during planting and harvest, minimal activity otherwise. Weather significantly impacts timing and volume. Prices for agricultural products fluctuate, affecting customers' freight budgets. Rural locations can be difficult for carriers to reach, especially during spring mud season or winter weather.</p>

    <h2>Your best approach</h2>

    <p>Build relationships before peak season and maintain them year-round despite slow periods. Develop a network of carriers willing to serve rural areas. Understand agricultural calendars and market dynamics for the crops your customers produce. Be flexible with timing because weather often disrupts schedules.</p>
