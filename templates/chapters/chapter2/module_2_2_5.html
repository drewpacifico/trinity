    <p>Farms, cooperatives, and agricultural processors move crops, livestock, feed, equipment, and supplies. The defining characteristic of this market is <strong>seasonality</strong>. Understanding harvest cycles is essential to working with agricultural customers.</p>

    <h2>Types of agricultural customers</h2>

    <p>Agricultural businesses vary widely. Knowing the differences helps you ask the right questions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Row crop farms:</strong> Corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton. Ship bulk grain to elevators or processors. Extremely seasonal, with intense activity during harvest and quiet periods otherwise.</li>
        <li><strong>Produce farms:</strong> Fruits and vegetables. Require <a href="{{ url_for('trucks') }}#refrigerated-trailer-reefer" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">refrigerated trailers<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-image"><img src="/static/images/reefer.jpeg" alt="Refrigerated trailer"></span><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Refrigerated Trailer (Reefer)</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Insulated trailers with refrigeration units maintaining temperatures from -20°F to +70°F. Essential for produce, dairy, meat, and temperature-sensitive goods.</span></span></a> and time-sensitive delivery. Spoilage risk means delays are costly.</li>
        <li><strong>Livestock operations:</strong> Cattle, hogs, poultry. Specialized livestock trailers with animal welfare regulations. Most new agents don't work this niche.</li>
        <li><strong>Dairy farms:</strong> Daily milk pickup to processing plants. Tanker equipment, food-grade requirements, strict schedules.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooperatives and processors:</strong> Aggregate from multiple farms. Higher volumes, more consistent shipping, often year-round operations.</li>
    </ul>

            Where New Agents Start
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p>Most new agents working agricultural freight focus on <strong>produce</strong> (reefer loads) or <strong>cooperatives/processors</strong> (more consistent volumes). Bulk grain requires hopper trailers and livestock requires specialized equipment. Both are niche markets with dedicated brokers. You'll learn more about equipment types in Chapter 4.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>The seasonality factor</h2>

    <p>Agriculture follows nature's calendar. Understanding when your customers are busiest helps you prospect at the right time and plan for capacity challenges:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spring (March-May):</strong> Planting season. Inbound shipments of seed, fertilizer, and equipment. Farmers are busy in fields and hard to reach by phone.</li>
        <li><strong>Summer (June-August):</strong> Produce harvest begins. Fruits and vegetables moving from farms to markets. Reefer capacity tightens. Rates rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Fall (September-November):</strong> Peak harvest for row crops. Grain moving to elevators. Produce season continues. This is the busiest period, and rates can spike 40-60% above off-season.</li>
        <li><strong>Winter (December-February):</strong> Slowest period. Equipment maintenance, planning for next year. Best time to build relationships for the coming season.</li>
    </ul>

            Timing Your Outreach
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p>Don't cold-call a farmer during harvest. They're working 16-hour days and won't take your call. The best time to build agricultural relationships is <strong>late winter</strong> (January-February) when farmers are planning their year and have time to talk. By the time harvest arrives, you should already be their trusted broker.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Why they're worth the complexity</h2>

    <p>Despite the challenges, agricultural customers offer real advantages:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>High-volume seasons:</strong> When harvest hits, volumes surge. A single customer can generate significant revenue in a few months.</li>
        <li><strong>Less competition:</strong> Rural locations and specialized requirements discourage many brokers. Agents who understand agriculture face fewer competitors.</li>
        <li><strong>Loyalty:</strong> Farmers value relationships. Once you prove reliable during a critical harvest, they'll call you first next year.</li>
        <li><strong>Premium rates:</strong> Time-sensitive produce and capacity-constrained harvest seasons command higher rates than typical freight.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges you'll face</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Feast or famine:</strong> Extreme seasonality means intense activity during harvest, minimal activity otherwise. Your income will fluctuate.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather dependence:</strong> Rain delays harvest. Early frost damages crops. Drought reduces yields. Plans change constantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Rural access:</strong> Farm locations may have unpaved roads, limited turning space, and no loading docks. Not all carriers will go there.</li>
        <li><strong>Price sensitivity:</strong> Commodity prices fluctuate. When crop prices drop, customers squeeze freight budgets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Questions to ask agricultural customers:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"What crops do you produce, and when is your harvest?"</strong> This tells you their peak season and equipment needs.</li>
        <li><strong>"Where does your product go after it leaves your farm?"</strong> This identifies lanes and receiver types (elevator, processor, distribution center).</li>
        <li><strong>"What equipment do you have on-site for loading?"</strong> Rural locations may lack forklifts or docks.</li>
        <li><strong>"How do you currently handle your freight during harvest?"</strong> This reveals pain points with current providers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Regulations you'll encounter</h2>

    <p>Agricultural freight has specific regulatory considerations you'll learn in detail in Chapter 6:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>FSMA (Food Safety Modernization Act):</strong> Food products require sanitary trailers, temperature documentation, and proper handling procedures.</li>
        <li><strong>Agricultural HOS exemption:</strong> During planting and harvest, drivers transporting agricultural commodities within 150 miles of the source operate under relaxed hours-of-service rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>If agriculture interests you, consider specializing:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Produce logistics:</strong> Fruits and vegetables from farm to market. Reefer expertise, time-sensitive delivery, food safety knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>Regional grain:</strong> If you're in agricultural areas (Midwest, Great Plains), grain movement to local elevators and processors.</li>
        <li><strong>Agricultural inputs:</strong> Seed, fertilizer, and equipment moving TO farms. Less seasonal than outbound crops.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Specialization in agriculture takes time because you need to learn crop cycles, regional patterns, and build carrier relationships before your first harvest season. Plan ahead.</p>
