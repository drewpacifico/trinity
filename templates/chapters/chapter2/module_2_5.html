<h2>What agencies regulate the freight industry?</h2>

    <p>Several government agencies regulate different aspects of the freight industry. Understanding their roles helps you navigate compliance requirements.</p>

<h2>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)</h2>

    <p>The FMCSA is the primary regulatory body for the trucking industry. It's part of the U.S. Department of Transportation.</p>

<h2>Key responsibilities:</h2>

    <p>Issuing operating authority for carriers and brokers. Enforcing safety regulations including driver qualifications, hours of service, vehicle maintenance, and drug testing. Maintaining safety rating systems (SMS scores) for carriers. Investigating accidents and compliance violations. Establishing and enforcing regulations for hazardous materials transportation.</p>

<h2>Why it matters to you:</h2>

    <p>You must verify carriers have active FMCSA authority and acceptable safety ratings before tendering freight. Understanding FMCSA regulations helps you set realistic expectations with customers and carriers. Brokers who use carriers without proper authority face significant liability.</p>

<h2>Department of Transportation (DOT)</h2>

    <p>The DOT is the parent agency setting broader transportation policy. It oversees the FMCSA along with other modal administrations (Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, etc.).</p>

    <p>The DOT establishes overarching policies affecting freight transportation, funds infrastructure improvements, and coordinates intermodal transportation policy.</p>

<h2>State Transportation Agencies</h2>

    <p>Each state has its own transportation department enforcing state-specific regulations. These might include special permits for oversize/overweight loads, state fuel taxes, intrastate operating requirements, and local weight restrictions.</p>

<h2>Why it matters:</h2>

    <p>Some shipments require state permits even if you're using a federally-authorized carrier. State weight limits may differ from federal limits. Some states have specific regulations for certain commodity types (like hazardous materials routing).</p>

    <h2>Industry Associations</h2>

    <p>While not regulatory bodies, several industry associations establish standards and provide advocacy:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Transportation Intermediaries Association (TIA):</strong> The primary trade association for freight brokers and third-party logistics providers. They provide education, networking, and advocacy.</li>
        <li><strong>American Trucking Associations (ATA):</strong> Represents the trucking industry, particularly larger carriers. They provide research, advocacy, and industry information.</li>
        <li><strong>State trucking associations:</strong> Most states have their own associations providing regional advocacy and networking.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These associations offer training programs, industry conferences, and networking opportunities that can accelerate your professional development.</p>
