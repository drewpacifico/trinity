    <p>Several government agencies regulate different aspects of the freight industry. You don't need to memorize every regulation, but you do need to know who enforces what and how to verify that carriers are authorized to operate. Chapter 6 covers specific regulations in detail. This module focuses on the agencies themselves and the verification tools you'll use daily.</p>

    <h2>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)</h2>

    <p>The FMCSA is the primary regulatory body for the trucking industry. It's part of the U.S. Department of Transportation and directly affects your work as a freight agent.</p>

    <h3>What FMCSA does</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Issues operating authority:</strong> Every carrier and broker needs an MC (Motor Carrier) number to operate legally. FMCSA grants and tracks this authority.</li>
        <li><strong>Enforces safety regulations:</strong> Rules covering driver qualifications, hours of service, vehicle maintenance, and drug testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintains safety ratings:</strong> The SMS (Safety Measurement System) scores carriers on safety performance. You'll check these before booking loads.</li>
        <li><strong>Investigates violations:</strong> Accidents, compliance failures, and complaints trigger FMCSA investigations.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulates hazardous materials:</strong> Special rules for transporting dangerous goods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why FMCSA matters to you</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Carrier verification is required:</strong> You must confirm carriers have active FMCSA authority before tendering freight. This isn't optional.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety ratings affect your choices:</strong> Carriers with poor safety scores or "Unsatisfactory" ratings shouldn't get your freight.</li>
        <li><strong>Liability protection:</strong> Using carriers without proper authority exposes you and your brokerage to significant legal and financial risk.</li>
    </ul>

            The SAFER System
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p>FMCSA's SAFER (Safety and Fitness Electronic Records) system at <strong>safer.fmcsa.dot.gov</strong> is your primary tool for carrier verification. Enter an MC or DOT number to see authority status, insurance on file, safety ratings, and inspection history. Bookmark this site. You'll use it constantly.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Broker authority and bonds</h2>

    <p>As an agent, you operate under your brokerage's authority. Understanding what that means helps you explain your role to customers and carriers.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>MC number:</strong> Your brokerage holds a Motor Carrier number with "Property Broker" authority from FMCSA. This is the legal authorization to arrange transportation.</li>
        <li><strong>Broker bond:</strong> Federal law requires brokers to maintain a $75,000 surety bond or trust fund. This protects carriers if the broker fails to pay.</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance requirements:</strong> Brokerages carry contingent cargo insurance and liability coverage to protect against claims.</li>
        <li><strong>Your position:</strong> You don't need your own authority. You work as an independent contractor under your brokerage's MC number and bond.</li>
    </ul>

            Never Skip Verification
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p>Using a carrier without verifying their authority isn't just risky. It's a compliance violation. If something goes wrong with an unverified carrier (accident, cargo theft, damage), you and your brokerage face serious liability. Your brokerage will have specific vetting requirements. Follow them every time, no exceptions.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Department of Transportation (DOT)</h2>

    <p>The DOT is the parent agency that oversees FMCSA along with other transportation agencies (Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, etc.).</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>DOT numbers:</strong> Every commercial vehicle operating interstate must have a DOT number. This is different from the MC number. Carriers have both.</li>
        <li><strong>Broader policy:</strong> DOT sets overarching transportation policy and funds infrastructure improvements.</li>
        <li><strong>Intermodal coordination:</strong> DOT coordinates policy across trucking, rail, air, and maritime transportation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>State transportation agencies</h2>

    <p>Each state has its own transportation department enforcing state-specific regulations. These add complexity to interstate freight.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Oversize/overweight permits:</strong> Loads exceeding standard dimensions need permits from each state they travel through.</li>
        <li><strong>State fuel taxes:</strong> The International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) handles reporting, but states set their own rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Intrastate requirements:</strong> Some states have additional requirements for freight that stays within their borders.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight limits:</strong> State limits may differ from federal limits on certain roads and bridges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Industry associations</h2>

    <p>While not regulatory bodies, these associations establish standards, provide education, and advocate for the industry. They're worth knowing about.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Transportation Intermediaries Association (TIA):</strong> The primary trade association for freight brokers and 3PLs. Offers training, certification programs, and networking. Many brokerages encourage agents to pursue TIA certification.</li>
        <li><strong>American Trucking Associations (ATA):</strong> Represents carriers, particularly larger fleets. Good source for industry research and trends.</li>
        <li><strong>State trucking associations:</strong> Regional advocacy and networking opportunities. Useful for building local carrier relationships.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Carrier verification steps you'll perform regularly:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check SAFER:</strong> Enter the carrier's MC or DOT number at safer.fmcsa.dot.gov. Confirm authority is "Active" and insurance is current.</li>
        <li><strong>Review safety scores:</strong> Look at CSA (Compliance, Safety, Accountability) scores. High scores in certain categories (like Unsafe Driving or HOS Compliance) are red flags.</li>
        <li><strong>Verify insurance:</strong> SAFER shows insurance on file, but your brokerage may require a current certificate of insurance directly from the carrier.</li>
        <li><strong>Check operating history:</strong> New authorities (under 90 days) require extra scrutiny. Some brokerages won't use carriers with less than 6 months of history.</li>
        <li><strong>Document everything:</strong> Keep records of your verification. If something goes wrong, you need to show you followed proper procedures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For new agents, prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Master SAFER:</strong> Learn to navigate the FMCSA SAFER system quickly. You'll check it before every new carrier relationship.</li>
        <li><strong>Know your brokerage's vetting process:</strong> Your brokerage has specific requirements for carrier approval. Learn them and follow them exactly.</li>
        <li><strong>Understand the basics:</strong> Know what MC numbers, DOT numbers, and broker bonds are so you can explain them when customers or carriers ask.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Save the details for later:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Specific regulations (hours of service, weight limits, hazmat rules) are covered in Chapter 6</li>
        <li>State-by-state permit requirements come with experience on specific lanes</li>
        <li>Industry association membership and certifications can wait until you're established</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your immediate job is verification: confirming every carrier you use is legally authorized and safe to operate. Everything else builds on that foundation.</p>
