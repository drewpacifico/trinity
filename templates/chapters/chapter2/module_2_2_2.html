    <p>Distributors buy products from manufacturers and sell them to retailers or other businesses. They operate warehouses and distribution centers, shipping products to multiple destinations regularly. For freight agents, distributors often represent the ideal customer: high volume, diverse lanes, and consistent shipping patterns.</p>

    <h2>How distributors work</h2>

    <p>Understanding the distributor business model helps you serve them better:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inventory turns matter:</strong> Distributors make money by moving products quickly. The faster inventory turns over, the more profitable they are. Speed of delivery directly affects their bottom line.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple suppliers, multiple customers:</strong> They receive inbound freight from manufacturers and ship outbound to retailers, contractors, or other businesses. Both directions create freight opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>Warehouse operations:</strong> They have professional shipping and receiving docks with forklifts and trained staff. Loading and unloading is usually efficient.</li>
        <li><strong>Freight is a major cost:</strong> Transportation is one of their largest expense categories. They track it closely and negotiate hard.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of distributors</h2>

    <p>Distributors specialize by industry. Each has different freight characteristics:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Food and beverage distributors:</strong> Often need <a href="{{ url_for('trucks') }}#refrigerated-trailer-reefer" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">refrigerated trailers<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-image"><img src="/static/images/reefer.jpeg" alt="Refrigerated trailer"></span><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Refrigerated Trailer (Reefer)</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Insulated trailers with refrigeration units maintaining temperatures from -20°F to +70°F. Essential for produce, dairy, meat, and temperature-sensitive goods.</span></span></a>. Time-sensitive deliveries to restaurants, grocery stores, and institutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Industrial distributors:</strong> Parts, tools, equipment for manufacturing and construction. Often ship heavy items requiring proper securement.</li>
        <li><strong>Building materials distributors:</strong> Lumber, plumbing, electrical, HVAC. May need flatbed for oversized items. Deliver to job sites and retail locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical and pharmaceutical:</strong> Temperature-controlled, time-critical, with strict handling requirements. Higher rates but more complexity.</li>
        <li><strong>General merchandise:</strong> Consumer goods, housewares, retail products. Mostly <a href="{{ url_for('trucks') }}#dry-van-trailer" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">dry van<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-image"><img src="/static/images/dry_van.jpeg" alt="Dry van trailer"></span><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Dry Van Trailer</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">The most common trailer type: an enclosed rectangular box (53'×8.5'×9' interior) with 43,000-45,000 lb capacity, used for general freight not requiring temperature control.</span></span></a> freight.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why distributors make excellent customers</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>High volume:</strong> They ship frequently, creating substantial commission opportunities. One good distributor can anchor your business.</li>
        <li><strong>Diverse lanes:</strong> Multiple destinations mean you can build expertise across many routes.</li>
        <li><strong>Less seasonal:</strong> They handle products from many suppliers, smoothing out seasonal fluctuations that affect individual manufacturers.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional operations:</strong> Dock facilities, regular hours, experienced staff. Carriers appreciate efficient loading and unloading.</li>
        <li><strong>Month-end surges:</strong> Distributors push to hit sales targets at month and quarter end, creating predictable volume spikes.</li>
    </ul>

            The Overflow Strategy
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p>Distributors typically have primary carriers they use for most freight. Don't try to replace them immediately. Instead, position yourself as the "overflow valve." When their regular carriers hit capacity or can't cover a load, you become the reliable backup. This reduces competition, creates urgent opportunities at premium rates, and proves your value without a head-to-head price fight.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Challenges you'll face</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Price sensitivity:</strong> Freight is a major cost they track closely. Expect hard negotiations and rate comparisons.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple brokers:</strong> Large distributors use several brokers simultaneously. You're competing on every load.</li>
        <li><strong>Service expectations:</strong> They need fast quotes, quick pickup confirmations, and proactive communication. Slow response loses business.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment terms:</strong> Larger distributors may have 30-45 day payment terms. Check with your brokerage about credit approval.</li>
        <li><strong>Volume requirements:</strong> Some want brokers who can handle their entire freight program. New agents may need to start with partial business.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What distributors expect from you</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quick response:</strong> Quote requests should be answered within an hour, not a day. They're comparing multiple options.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliable capacity:</strong> When you commit to a load, you cover it. Failed pickups damage the relationship quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Proactive updates:</strong> Don't wait for them to call asking where the truck is. Communicate status before they need to ask.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility on volume:</strong> They need partners who can scale up for promotions or seasonal pushes and scale down during slow periods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Questions to ask distributor prospects:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"What products do you distribute, and do any require temperature control?"</strong> Determines equipment needs and specialization required.</li>
        <li><strong>"How many shipments do you move per week, and to what regions?"</strong> Reveals volume and lane opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>"How do you currently handle overflow when your primary carriers can't cover loads?"</strong> Opens the door to the overflow strategy.</li>
        <li><strong>"What's most important to you: rate, reliability, or responsiveness?"</strong> Helps you understand their priorities and how to position your service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For new agents, prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Regional distributors:</strong> Large enough for consistent volume but not so large they only work with major brokerages.</li>
        <li><strong>Specialty distributors:</strong> Niche products (restaurant supplies, industrial parts, building materials) where expertise matters more than lowest price.</li>
        <li><strong>Growing distributors:</strong> Companies expanding their territory or product lines. They need additional freight capacity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Approach with caution:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>National distributors with corporate logistics teams and existing contracts</li>
        <li>Distributors known for slow payment or frequent disputes</li>
        <li>Companies requiring equipment or lanes where you lack carrier relationships</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Distributors reward agents who respond quickly, deliver reliably, and can handle volume fluctuations. Start as their backup, prove your value, and earn a larger share of their freight over time.</p>
