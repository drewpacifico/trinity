    <p>Distributors buy products from manufacturers and sell them to retailers or other businesses. They operate warehouses or distribution centers and ship products to multiple destinations regularly.</p>

    <h2>What makes them good customers</h2>

    <p>High shipping volumes create substantial commission opportunities. Multiple destinations mean diverse lane opportunities. They're often less seasonal than manufacturers because they distribute products from many suppliers. They value efficiency and speed because their business model depends on rapid inventory turns.</p>

    <h2>Challenges you'll face</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Price sensitivity:</strong> Freight is a major expense category, so they negotiate hard</li>
        <li><strong>High competition:</strong> They may use multiple brokers and carriers simultaneously</li>
        <li><strong>Service expectations:</strong> They need fast quotes, quick pickup confirmations, and minimal delays</li>
        <li><strong>Payment terms:</strong> The payment terms may be longer than they are forsmaller customers</li>
    </ul>

            Pro Tip
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Focus on becoming the "overflow valve" for distributors. When their regular carriers hit capacity, you become their reliable backup. This reduces competition and creates urgent, premium-rate opportunities.

    <h2>Your best approach</h2>

    <p>Demonstrate your ability to handle volume efficiently. Show you can provide consistent service across multiple lanes simultaneously. Emphasize your capacity to scale up or down as their needs fluctuate. Build relationships with the logistics team and understand their key performance metrics so you can help them succeed.</p>
