<h2>What types of carriers will you work with?</h2>

    <p>Carriers are the trucking companies that actually move freight. Understanding the different types helps you select appropriate carriers for specific situations and build a reliable network.</p>

<h2>Asset-Based Carriers</h2>

    <p>Asset-based carriers own their trucks and employ or contract with drivers. They range from single-truck owner-operators to massive national fleets with thousands of trucks.</p>

<h2>Owner-Operators:</h2>

    <p>Independent drivers who own and operate their own trucks. They're their own boss, making all decisions about which loads to accept and when to run.</p>

<strong>Strengths:</strong> Often provide excellent, personalized service because their reputation directly affects their business. Typically very responsive and communicative. More flexible with special requests because they control their own schedule.

<strong>Limitations:</strong> No backup if their truck breaks down or they become unavailable. Capacity is limited to one truck. May have less sophisticated systems for tracking and communication. Insurance and authority must be verified carefully because they're small businesses.

<strong>When to use them:</strong> For loads requiring special attention, white-glove service, or when you've built a strong relationship and trust their reliability. Excellent for consistent lanes where you can provide regular freight.

        <div class="callout-content">
            Build loyal relationships with 5-10 reliable owner-operators on your key lanes. When capacity gets tight, these relationships become gold. They'll answer your calls when they ignore everyone else's.

<h2>Small Fleet Owners (2-10 trucks):</h2>

    <p>Small businesses operating multiple trucks with hired drivers.</p>

<strong>Strengths:</strong> More capacity than single owner-operators but still personally managed. Often competitive on rates. Generally responsive and flexible. Provide good customer service because owners are directly involved.

<strong>Limitations:</strong> Limited geographic coverage. May not have sophisticated technology systems. Capacity can still be constrained during peak periods.

<strong>When to use them:</strong> For regional freight within their operating area. When building long-term partnerships where you can provide consistent volume. For loads requiring personal attention but backup capacity.

<h2>Medium Fleets (10-100 trucks):</h2>

    <p>Established companies with professional management, dedicated dispatchers, and more infrastructure.</p>

<strong>Strengths:</strong> Sufficient capacity to handle volume. Usually have decent tracking systems and professional operations. More financial stability than very small carriers. Can often provide multiple trucks for larger shipping needs.

<strong>Limitations:</strong> May be less flexible than smaller carriers. Service quality can vary depending on dispatcher and driver assigned. May have minimum volume expectations or preferred customer relationships.

<strong>When to use them:</strong> For customers requiring consistent capacity across multiple lanes. When you need reliability and professional operations. For moderate volume that justifies relationship investment.

<h2>Large National Carriers (100+ trucks):</h2>

    <p>Major companies operating nationwide with extensive equipment and resources.</p>

<strong>Strengths:</strong> Capacity to handle significant volume. Geographic reach across entire country. Sophisticated technology and tracking systems. Financial stability and proper insurance. Established safety and compliance programs.

<strong>Limitations:</strong> May be less flexible on rates and terms. Service quality can be inconsistent across their large driver pool. May not prioritize small broker relationships. Often have preferred customers receiving priority capacity.

    <p><strong>When to use them:</strong> For large customers requiring significant capacity. When national coverage is essential. For customers who require carriers with specific certifications or credentials. During tight capacity markets when you need reliable access to trucks.</p>

    <h2>Common Carriers vs. Contract Carriers</h2>

    <p>This legal distinction matters for understanding carrier obligations:</p>

    <p><strong>Common carriers</strong> offer services to the general public and are required by law to serve without discrimination. They must provide service to anyone willing to pay published rates (subject to capacity availability). Most trucking companies you'll work with are common carriers.</p>

    <p><strong>Contract carriers</strong> work under specific contracts with particular shippers. They're not required to serve the general public. Large manufacturers often have contract carrier relationships for their regular freight needs.</p>

    <h2>Dedicated Carriers</h2>

    <p>Some carriers assign specific trucks and drivers to specific customers through dedicated contracts. The customer essentially leases capacity for a defined period, paying for availability whether or not they use full capacity.</p>

    <p>This rarely affects freight agents directly, but understanding it explains why some carriers won't take brokered loads because they're fully committed to dedicated operations.</p>
