    <p>Carriers are the trucking companies that actually move freight. As a freight agent, you're the middleman between shippers (your customers) and carriers (your service providers). Understanding different carrier types helps you select the right partner for each load and build a reliable network over time.</p>

    <h2>Types of carriers</h2>

    <p>Carriers range from single-truck owner-operators to massive national fleets. Each type has strengths and limitations that affect when you should use them.</p>

    <h3>Owner-Operators</h3>

    <p>Independent drivers who own and operate their own truck. They make all decisions about which loads to accept and when to run.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Excellent personalized service because their reputation is their business. Very responsive and communicative. Flexible with special requests since they control their own schedule.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> No backup if their truck breaks down. Capacity limited to one truck. May have less sophisticated tracking systems. Must verify insurance and authority carefully.</li>
        <li><strong>When to use:</strong> Loads requiring special attention or white-glove service. Consistent lanes where you can provide regular freight. When you've built trust and know their reliability.</li>
    </ul>

            Build Your Core Network
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p>Build loyal relationships with 5-10 reliable owner-operators on your key lanes. When capacity gets tight, these relationships become invaluable. They'll answer your calls when they ignore everyone else's.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Small Fleet Owners (2-10 trucks)</h3>

    <p>Small businesses operating multiple trucks with hired drivers. The owner is usually still directly involved in operations.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> More capacity than owner-operators but still personally managed. Often competitive on rates. Responsive and flexible. Good service because owners are directly involved.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Limited geographic coverage. May lack sophisticated technology. Capacity still constrained during peak periods.</li>
        <li><strong>When to use:</strong> Regional freight within their operating area. Long-term partnerships where you provide consistent volume. Loads needing personal attention but with backup capacity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Medium Fleets (10-100 trucks)</h3>

    <p>Established companies with professional management, dedicated dispatchers, and operational infrastructure.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Sufficient capacity to handle volume. Usually have decent tracking systems. More financial stability. Can provide multiple trucks for larger needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Less flexible than smaller carriers. Service quality varies by dispatcher and driver. May have minimum volume expectations or preferred customers.</li>
        <li><strong>When to use:</strong> Customers requiring consistent capacity across multiple lanes. When you need reliability and professional operations. Moderate volume that justifies relationship investment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Large National Carriers (100+ trucks)</h3>

    <p>Major companies operating nationwide with extensive equipment and resources.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Capacity for significant volume. Geographic reach across entire country. Sophisticated tracking systems. Financial stability and proper insurance. Established safety and compliance programs.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Less flexible on rates and terms. Service quality inconsistent across large driver pool. May not prioritize small broker relationships. Preferred customers get priority capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>When to use:</strong> Large customers requiring significant capacity. When national coverage is essential. Customers requiring carriers with specific certifications. Tight capacity markets when you need reliable truck access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Carrier classifications</h2>

    <p>Beyond size, carriers are classified by how they operate:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Common carriers:</strong> Offer services to the general public and must serve without discrimination. Most trucking companies you'll work with are common carriers.</li>
        <li><strong>Contract carriers:</strong> Work under specific contracts with particular shippers. Not required to serve the general public. Large manufacturers often have contract carrier relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Dedicated carriers:</strong> Assign specific trucks and drivers to specific customers through dedicated contracts. The customer leases capacity for a defined period. These carriers often won't take brokered loads because they're fully committed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What carriers expect from you</h2>

    <p>The broker-carrier relationship goes both ways. Carriers choose who they work with, and good carriers have options. Here's what they expect:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accurate load information:</strong> Weight, dimensions, pickup/delivery details, and special requirements upfront. Surprises frustrate drivers and damage relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Fair rates:</strong> They know market rates. Consistently low-balling means they stop answering your calls.</li>
        <li><strong>Quick payment:</strong> Standard is 30 days, but carriers prefer faster. Quick pay options (paying sooner for a small fee) build loyalty.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect for their time:</strong> Long detention at shippers/receivers costs them money. Communicate expected wait times honestly.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional communication:</strong> Return calls promptly. Provide updates without being asked. Handle problems fairly.</li>
    </ul>

            Carrier Relationships Matter
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p>In tight markets, carriers choose who to work with. Brokers known for low rates, slow payment, or difficult customers get ignored. Brokers known for fair treatment and reliable freight get their calls returned. Your reputation with carriers is as important as your reputation with customers.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Vetting carriers</h2>

    <p>Before booking a load with any carrier, you need to verify they're legitimate and qualified. Your brokerage will have specific vetting requirements, but here are the basics:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Operating authority:</strong> Verify active MC (Motor Carrier) number through FMCSA's SAFER system. Authority must be active, not pending or revoked.</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Confirm adequate cargo and liability insurance. Certificates should be current and list your brokerage as certificate holder.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety rating:</strong> Check CSA scores and inspection history. Avoid carriers with "Unsatisfactory" ratings or concerning safety patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Time in business:</strong> New authorities (under 90 days) require extra scrutiny. Some brokerages won't use carriers under 6 months old.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment verification:</strong> Confirm they have appropriate equipment for the load. A carrier claiming flatbed capacity should actually have flatbeds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Red flags to watch for</h2>

    <p>Some warning signs indicate potential problems:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rates too good to be true:</strong> A carrier offering significantly below market rate may be desperate, inexperienced, or planning to renegotiate after pickup.</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure to book immediately:</strong> Legitimate carriers understand you need to verify credentials. Pushback on vetting is concerning.</li>
        <li><strong>Inconsistent information:</strong> Phone numbers that don't match FMCSA records, email domains that differ from company name, or details that don't add up.</li>
        <li><strong>No verifiable history:</strong> Brand new authority with no track record and no references is higher risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication problems:</strong> If they're hard to reach before the load, imagine what happens when there's a problem during transit.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout-example">
        <div class="callout-title">
            <span class="callout-icon">&#128161;</span>
            Double Brokering
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p>Double brokering occurs when a carrier accepts your load then re-brokers it to another carrier without your knowledge. This is usually prohibited by your rate confirmation. It creates liability issues and reduces service control. Watch for signs: carrier contact info changes, truck/driver details don't match what was dispatched, or the person who answers tracking calls seems unfamiliar with the load.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Building your carrier network</h2>

    <p>A strong carrier network is one of your most valuable assets. Here's how to build it:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Start with your lanes:</strong> Focus on finding reliable carriers for the routes you book most often. Depth on key lanes beats breadth across many.</li>
        <li><strong>Use load boards strategically:</strong> Load boards like DAT and Truckstop help you find carriers, but relationships matter more. Use boards to find carriers, then build direct relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask for referrals:</strong> Good carriers know other good carriers. When you find someone reliable, ask who else they'd recommend.</li>
        <li><strong>Treat carriers well:</strong> Fair rates, accurate information, quick payment, and respectful communication make carriers want to work with you again.</li>
        <li><strong>Track performance:</strong> Note which carriers deliver on time, communicate well, and handle problems professionally. Prioritize them for future loads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Questions to ask when talking to a new carrier:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"What's your MC number?"</strong> Verify it matches FMCSA records and is active.</li>
        <li><strong>"What equipment do you have?"</strong> Confirm they have appropriate trailers for your freight types.</li>
        <li><strong>"What lanes do you run regularly?"</strong> Carriers are more reliable on lanes they know well.</li>
        <li><strong>"How do you prefer to communicate?"</strong> Some prefer calls, others text or email. Knowing their preference improves responsiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>"What's your typical payment terms expectation?"</strong> Sets expectations and identifies if quick pay would help the relationship.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For new agents, prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Owner-operators and small fleets:</strong> More willing to work with newer brokers. Easier to build personal relationships. More flexible on load requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Regional specialists:</strong> Carriers who focus on specific regions know the lanes, shippers, and receivers. Their expertise adds value.</li>
        <li><strong>Carriers referred by other agents:</strong> If a colleague recommends a carrier, that's worth more than a random load board contact.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Approach with caution:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Very new authorities (under 90 days) without references</li>
        <li>Carriers with poor safety scores or recent violations</li>
        <li>Anyone pressuring you to skip vetting procedures</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your carrier network grows over time. Every load is an opportunity to find a new reliable partner or strengthen an existing relationship. Invest in these relationships because they'll carry your business when capacity gets tight.</p>
