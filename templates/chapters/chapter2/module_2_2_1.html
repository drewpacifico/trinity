    <p>Manufacturers produce goods that need regular shipment to distributors, retailers, or other facilities. A furniture manufacturer ships finished products to retail stores. An automotive parts producer sends components to assembly plants. A food processor moves packaged goods to distribution centers. For freight agents, manufacturers often make ideal long-term customers because of their consistent shipping patterns.</p>

    <h2>How manufacturing freight works</h2>

    <p>Understanding the manufacturing business helps you serve them better:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Two types of freight:</strong> Manufacturers ship finished goods outbound and receive raw materials and components inbound. Both directions create opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>Production schedules drive freight:</strong> They produce on regular cycles. If a plant runs three shifts and produces 500 units daily, they ship a predictable number of truckloads weekly.</li>
        <li><strong>Freight is a cost center:</strong> Transportation is a significant expense they track and manage carefully. They negotiate hard because savings go straight to the bottom line.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability matters most:</strong> A late delivery can shut down a production line. A late shipment can mean missed customer commitments. They pay for reliability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of manufacturing customers</h2>

    <p>Manufacturing spans many industries. Each has different freight characteristics:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Food and beverage:</strong> Often need <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#refrigerated-trailer-reefer" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">refrigerated trailers<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-image"><img src="/static/images/reefer.jpeg" alt="Refrigerated trailer"></span><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Refrigerated Trailer (Reefer)</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Insulated trailers with refrigeration units maintaining temperatures from -20°F to +70°F. Essential for produce, dairy, meat, and temperature-sensitive goods.</span></span></a>. Strict food safety requirements. Time-sensitive due to shelf life.</li>
        <li><strong>Automotive and machinery:</strong> Components for assembly plants. Often just-in-time delivery with tight windows. Mix of small parts (LTL) and large equipment (<a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#flatbed-trailer" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">flatbed<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-image"><img src="/static/images/flatbed.jpeg" alt="Flatbed trailer"></span><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Flatbed Trailer</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">An open platform trailer (48' or 53' long) without sides or roof, used for freight requiring top/side loading or exceeding enclosed trailer dimensions.</span></span></a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer goods:</strong> Packaged products heading to distribution centers and retailers. Mostly <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#dry-van-trailer" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">dry van<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-image"><img src="/static/images/dry_van.jpeg" alt="Dry van trailer"></span><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Dry Van Trailer</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">The most common trailer type: an enclosed rectangular box (53'×8.5'×9' interior) with 43,000-45,000 lb capacity, used for general freight not requiring temperature control.</span></span></a> freight. High volume, competitive rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Industrial equipment:</strong> Machinery, tools, heavy components. May require flatbed or specialized handling. Higher-value freight with less price sensitivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Building products:</strong> Lumber, windows, roofing, concrete products. Often need flatbed. Delivery to job sites as well as distributors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why manufacturers make good customers</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Predictable patterns:</strong> Production schedules create consistent freight volumes. You can forecast and plan capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-term relationships:</strong> Once you prove reliable, manufacturers stick with you. They don't want to constantly re-qualify new vendors.</li>
        <li><strong>They understand logistics:</strong> You're not educating them on how freight works. They know what they need and communicate clearly.</li>
        <li><strong>Growth potential:</strong> A small manufacturer shipping 5 loads monthly today might ship 20 monthly in two years. Growing with them compounds your business.</li>
        <li><strong>Month-end and quarter-end surges:</strong> Manufacturers push to meet production targets at period end, creating predictable volume spikes.</li>
    </ul>

            Just-In-Time Delivery
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p>Some manufacturers use just-in-time (JIT) inventory systems. Parts must arrive within precise time windows. Early delivery is often as problematic as late delivery because they lack storage space. Late delivery can shut down a production line costing thousands per hour. If a customer mentions JIT requirements, understand exactly what that means before committing.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Challenges you'll face</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Established relationships:</strong> Most manufacturers have carrier relationships built over years. You're not their first call.</li>
        <li><strong>Procurement processes:</strong> Larger manufacturers have formal vendor qualification, competitive bidding, and contract requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Price pressure:</strong> Freight is a major cost. They compare rates constantly and expect competitive pricing.</li>
        <li><strong>Strict requirements:</strong> Insurance minimums, safety ratings, equipment specifications. They qualify carriers carefully.</li>
        <li><strong>High stakes:</strong> Miss a delivery and you might shut down a production line. The consequences of failure are significant.</li>
    </ul>

            The Capacity Supplement Strategy
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p>Don't try to replace a manufacturer's primary carriers. Instead, position yourself as their capacity supplement. During peak seasons, month-end pushes, or when regular carriers are full, they need backup options. Start as their "Plan B" and prove your value. Over time, you earn more of their business without a head-to-head price fight.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>What manufacturers expect from you</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reliability above all:</strong> Cover the loads you commit to. Every time. No excuses.</li>
        <li><strong>On-time performance:</strong> Production schedules don't flex. Deliveries must arrive within committed windows.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> If there's a problem, tell them immediately. Surprises are unacceptable.</li>
        <li><strong>Qualified carriers:</strong> They'll ask about carrier safety ratings, insurance, and equipment. Be prepared to provide documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Questions to ask manufacturing prospects:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"What do you manufacture, and where does your finished product go?"</strong> Reveals freight types and lanes.</li>
        <li><strong>"How many outbound shipments do you move per week?"</strong> Quantifies opportunity size.</li>
        <li><strong>"Do you have strict delivery windows or just-in-time requirements?"</strong> Identifies service level expectations.</li>
        <li><strong>"How do you handle overflow when your regular carriers are at capacity?"</strong> Opens the door to the capacity supplement strategy.</li>
        <li><strong>"What's your carrier qualification process?"</strong> Helps you understand what you need to provide.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For new agents, prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Small to mid-sized manufacturers:</strong> Large enough for consistent volume but without corporate procurement bureaucracy. The shipping manager often makes decisions directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Growing manufacturers:</strong> Companies adding production capacity or new product lines. They need additional freight capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Specialty manufacturers:</strong> Niche products where expertise matters. Less price competition than commodity goods.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Approach with caution:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Large manufacturers with corporate procurement and contract requirements</li>
        <li>JIT operations unless you have reliable carriers who understand tight windows</li>
        <li>Industries requiring equipment or expertise you don't have</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Manufacturers reward consistency and reliability over time. Start as their backup, deliver flawlessly, and earn a larger share of their freight as you prove your value.</p>
