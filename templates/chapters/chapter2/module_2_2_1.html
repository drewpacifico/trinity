    <p>Manufacturers produce goods that need regular shipment to distributors, retailers, or other facilities. A furniture manufacturer ships finished products to retail stores. An automotive parts producer sends components to assembly plants. A food processor moves packaged goods to distribution centers.</p>

    <h2>What makes them good customers</h2>

    <p>Manufacturers typically have predictable shipping patterns. They produce on regular schedules, which means consistent freight needs. They understand logistics because it's core to their operations. They value reliability because production schedules depend on timely delivery of materials and timely shipment of finished goods.</p>

    <h2>Challenges you'll face</h2>

    <p>Many manufacturers have established carrier relationships built over years. They often have sophisticated procurement processes with competitive bidding requirements. They expect very competitive pricing because freight is a significant cost center. They may have stringent requirements for carrier qualifications, insurance levels, and performance metrics.</p>

            Pro Tip
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Don't try to replace a manufacturer's primary carriers. Instead, position yourself as their capacity supplement for peak seasons and backup situations. This reduces resistance and creates win-win opportunities.

    <h2>Your best approach</h2>

    <p>Position yourself as a capacity supplement rather than trying to replace their primary carriers. During peak seasons, when regular carriers are full, they need backup options. Emphasize reliability and service quality over rock-bottom pricing. Demonstrate expertise in their specific product type and shipping requirements.</p>
