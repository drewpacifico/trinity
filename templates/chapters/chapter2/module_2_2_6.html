    <p>Online retailers and direct-to-consumer brands move products from manufacturers to fulfillment centers, between warehouses, and sometimes to end customers. This is a rapidly growing market, but it comes with unique challenges you need to understand before pursuing these customers.</p>

    <h2>Types of e-commerce customers</h2>

    <p>E-commerce businesses vary widely in size, sophistication, and freight needs:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands:</strong> Companies selling their own products online. Often newer businesses with growing volume. May lack logistics experience but are eager to learn.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketplace sellers:</strong> Businesses selling through Amazon, Walmart, or other platforms. Need to move inventory to marketplace fulfillment centers. Volume can be unpredictable.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription box companies:</strong> Regular, predictable shipping patterns. Need consistent capacity each month. Good fit once they reach truckload volumes.</li>
        <li><strong>Traditional retailers with e-commerce:</strong> Established companies adding online sales. Already understand logistics but may need help scaling fulfillment operations.</li>
    </ul>

            Best Fit for New Agents
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p>Look for e-commerce companies that have outgrown parcel shipping but haven't yet established carrier relationships. They need education and guidance, which is where you add value. Avoid very early-stage startups with no shipping history and uncertain credit.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Parcel vs freight: the education gap</h2>

    <p>Many e-commerce companies start by shipping individual orders through UPS, FedEx, or USPS. When their volume grows, they need to shift some shipments to freight carriers. This is where confusion happens.</p>

    <p><strong>What they're used to (parcel):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Guaranteed next-day or two-day delivery</li>
        <li>Real-time tracking updated every few hours</li>
        <li>Automatic insurance and easy claims</li>
        <li>Pick up from any location, deliver to any address</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What freight actually looks like:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transit times measured in days, not hours</li>
        <li>Tracking updates at pickup, in transit, and delivery</li>
        <li>Claims require documentation and take time to resolve</li>
        <li>Dock-to-dock delivery is standard. Residential or liftgate costs extra.</li>
    </ul>

            Set Expectations Early
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p>Don't assume e-commerce companies understand freight logistics. Many think everything ships like Amazon Prime packages. Take time to educate them on the differences between small package and freight transportation. If you don't set expectations upfront, every shipment becomes a complaint.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Their freight patterns</h2>

    <p>E-commerce freight typically moves in two directions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inbound to fulfillment:</strong> Bulk shipments from manufacturers or suppliers to warehouses and fulfillment centers. This is truckload or <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#less-than-truckload-ltl" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">LTL<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Less-Than-Truckload (LTL)</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">Freight service consolidating shipments from multiple shippers (typically 150-10,000 pounds), priced by freight class.</span></span></a> freight and the most common opportunity for freight agents.</li>
        <li><strong>Transfers between facilities:</strong> Moving inventory between fulfillment centers or from overflow storage. Often time-sensitive during peak seasons.</li>
        <li><strong>Outbound to customers:</strong> Usually handled by parcel carriers, but large items (furniture, appliances, fitness equipment) may need freight delivery with white-glove service.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Volume patterns to know:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Holiday peak:</strong> October through December is intense. Inbound freight surges as companies stock up for Black Friday and Christmas.</li>
        <li><strong>Prime Day and sales events:</strong> Marketplace sellers spike volume before major promotional events.</li>
        <li><strong>Product launches:</strong> New product releases create sudden volume increases with tight timelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Returns season:</strong> January sees reverse logistics as holiday returns flow back.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What they expect from you</h2>

    <p>E-commerce companies are digital-first businesses. They expect:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fast response times:</strong> They're used to instant communication. Respond to emails and texts within hours, not days.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time visibility:</strong> They want tracking updates and proactive communication about delays.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Volume fluctuates. They need partners who can scale up or down quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Tech-savvy communication:</strong> Many prefer text, Slack, or email over phone calls. Meet them where they are.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Credit and payment risks</h2>

    <p>E-commerce includes many newer businesses, and not all of them are financially stable. Be cautious with:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Venture-funded startups:</strong> May have cash now but burn through it quickly. High growth doesn't mean profitability.</li>
        <li><strong>Very new businesses:</strong> No shipping history means no credit history. Your brokerage may require prepayment or limit credit.</li>
        <li><strong>Businesses with rapid growth claims:</strong> "We're growing 500% this year" sounds exciting until they can't pay invoices.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout-example">

            <span class="callout-icon">&#128161;</span>
            Protect Yourself
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p>Before taking on a new e-commerce customer, check with your brokerage about credit approval. Start with smaller shipments and shorter payment terms. A customer who pays their first five invoices on time is worth extending more credit. A customer who disputes every invoice is a warning sign.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Why they're worth pursuing</h2>

    <p>Despite the challenges, e-commerce offers real opportunities:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Growth potential:</strong> A small e-commerce company today could be a major shipper in two years. Growing with them builds loyalty.</li>
        <li><strong>Less established competition:</strong> Many don't have entrenched carrier relationships. You're not displacing a 20-year vendor.</li>
        <li><strong>They value expertise:</strong> If you help them navigate freight logistics, they'll see you as a partner, not a commodity.</li>
        <li><strong>Recurring freight:</strong> Inbound replenishment shipments happen regularly as they restock inventory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Questions to ask e-commerce prospects:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"How are you currently handling inbound freight to your fulfillment center?"</strong> Reveals if they're using freight brokers, parcel, or managing it themselves.</li>
        <li><strong>"What's your typical shipment size and frequency?"</strong> Determines if they're a good fit for LTL, truckload, or still in parcel territory.</li>
        <li><strong>"How long have you been in business, and what's your shipping volume trend?"</strong> Helps assess stability and growth trajectory.</li>
        <li><strong>"What fulfillment model do you use?"</strong> Self-fulfilled, 3PL, marketplace fulfillment (FBA). Each has different freight needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>Not all e-commerce customers are equal. Prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Established DTC brands with consistent volume:</strong> Companies shipping at least a few LTL or truckload shipments per month. Stable enough to be reliable.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription box companies at scale:</strong> Predictable monthly patterns make capacity planning easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Traditional retailers expanding online:</strong> Already understand freight and have credit history.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Approach with caution:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pre-revenue startups still figuring out their product</li>
        <li>Companies with no freight history wanting instant credit</li>
        <li>Businesses expecting parcel service levels at freight prices</li>
    </ul>

    <p>E-commerce is a growth market, but success requires educating customers, setting expectations, and carefully vetting credit risk.</p>
