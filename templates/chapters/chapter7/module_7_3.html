    <p>Effective prospecting starts with systematically identifying businesses likely to need your services. Random cold calling wastes time. Targeted research focusing on qualified prospects produces far better results.</p>

    <h2>Online Research Techniques</h2>

    <p>Modern prospecting leverages online resources to identify and qualify prospects before making contact.</p>

    <h3>Company Websites</h3>
    <p>Visit websites of potential prospects looking for indicators of shipping activity:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Careers" pages</strong> listing shipping/receiving positions indicate active shipping operations</li>
        <li><strong>"About Us" pages</strong> mentioning distribution centers or multiple locations suggest inter-facility shipping</li>
        <li><strong>Product catalogs</strong> showing physical goods indicate freight transportation requirements</li>
        <li><strong>"Locations" pages</strong> listing multiple facilities suggest regular shipments between locations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Business Directories</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ReferenceUSA:</strong> Comprehensive database (often free through public libraries) with filters for industry, size, location</li>
        <li><strong>Hoovers/Dun & Bradstreet:</strong> Company profiles, financial data, contact information</li>
        <li><strong>Manta:</strong> Free business directory with basic company information</li>
        <li><strong>Industry-specific directories:</strong> Trade associations often maintain member directories</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>LinkedIn for B2B Prospecting</h3>
    <p>LinkedIn is extraordinarily valuable for identifying decision-makers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Search for job titles like "shipping manager," "logistics coordinator," "warehouse manager"</li>
        <li>Company pages show employee counts, locations, and business updates</li>
        <li>Employee movements: New hires in logistics roles haven't established vendor relationships</li>
        <li>Your network may connect you to decision-makers through mutual connections</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Local Business Journals</h3>
    <p>Business publications regularly cover company expansions, fast-growing companies, and new businesses—all indicators of freight needs.</p>

    <h2>Geographic Prospecting</h2>

    <p>Sometimes the most effective prospecting involves physical observation in your market.</p>

    <h3>Industrial Parks</h3>
    <p>Drive through systematically, noting company names and observing loading docks and truck traffic. Take photos of buildings with visible signage for later research.</p>

    <h3>Port Areas and Distribution Corridors</h3>
    <p>Areas near ports, intermodal facilities, or major interstate intersections host businesses built around freight movement.</p>

    <h2>Referral Generation</h2>

    <p>Your best prospects often come through referrals from people who know and trust you.</p>

    <h3>Existing Customers</h3>
    <p>After successfully handling several shipments, ask directly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Who else do you know in your industry who might benefit from our services?"</li>
        <li>"Do you work with suppliers or customers who might need reliable freight transportation?"</li>
        <li>"Would you be comfortable introducing me to colleagues at other companies?"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Carriers</h3>
    <p>Trucking companies know which businesses ship frequently. Ask: "Which <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#shipper" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">shippers<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Shipper</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A business needing to move goods from one location to another, including manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and other customer types.</span></span></a> might need additional <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#broker" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">broker<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Broker</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">An individual or company licensed by the FMCSA to arrange transportation of freight between shippers and carriers without owning trucks. Brokers find capacity, negotiate rates, and coordinate shipments, earning revenue from the margin between what shippers pay and what carriers receive.</span></span></a> support?"</p>

    <h3>Industry Peers</h3>
    <p>Other freight agents (especially in non-competing specialties) can refer overflow freight or shipments outside their focus.</p>

            <span class="callout-icon">&#128161;</span>
            Pro Tip
        </div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            Make referral requests specific: "Do you know anyone at [specific company]?" works better than vague "Do you know anyone who ships freight?" Specific questions are easier to answer and more likely to generate useful referrals.

    </div>

    <h2>Practical application</h2>

    <p>Questions to guide your prospecting research:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Does this company ship physical products?"</strong> Service companies without products don't need freight services.</li>
        <li><strong>"What size is this company?"</strong> Target mid-sized companies ($5M-$100M) who ship regularly but lack dedicated logistics teams.</li>
        <li><strong>"Can I identify the decision-maker?"</strong> Use LinkedIn to find shipping managers, logistics coordinators, or operations managers.</li>
        <li><strong>"Do I have any connections to this company?"</strong> Referrals and warm introductions are more effective than cold outreach.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to focus</h2>

    <p>For new agents, prioritize:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Research before calling:</strong> 30 minutes of research makes your call far more effective than random dialing.</li>
        <li><strong>Use LinkedIn:</strong> It's the most valuable tool for identifying decision-makers and their backgrounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask for referrals:</strong> Every happy customer and <a href="{{ url_for('glossary') }}#carrier" class="glossary-term-link" target="_blank">carrier<span class="glossary-tooltip"><span class="glossary-tooltip-term">Carrier</span><span class="glossary-tooltip-definition">A company or individual that transports goods from one place to another, including asset-based carriers, owner-operators, and fleet owners.</span></span></a> can introduce you to new prospects.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Targeted prospecting produces better results than volume-based cold calling. Quality research leads to quality conversations.</p>
